# AI Agent Guidelines

## Project Context

This repository contains steering files to help AI agents understand the project structure and architecture:

- **`.kiro/steering.md`** - Comprehensive project overview including architecture, core components, development workflow, and current limitations

## For AI Agents

When working with this codebase, please review the steering file first to understand:
- The ripper-based architecture for web scraping
- Configuration schema and directory structure  
- Base classes for HTML and JSON scraping
- Event processing and tag-based aggregation
- Current development workflow and limitations

The steering file provides essential context for making informed decisions about code changes, new feature implementations, and maintaining consistency with the existing architecture.
