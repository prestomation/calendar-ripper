DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wished you could go inside of a book? You could t
	ravel to a new place\\\, see new sights\\\, potentially live a different l
	ife altogether — all from the page. \\nFrom New York Times bestselling aut
	hor Kate Quinn comes Astral Library\\\, a fantastical novel where books ar
	e not merely objects\\\, but doors to different worlds\\\, different adven
	tures\\\, and different futures. \\nAfter growing up in the foster care sy
	stem\\\, protagonist Alix Watson came to believe one thing: unlike people\
	\\, books will never let you down. Working three dead-end jobs to make end
	s meet and letting her dreams of higher education fall to the wayside\\\, 
	Alix takes refuge in the reading room at the Boston Public Library\\\, rea
	ding her favorite fantasy novels and dreaming of faraway lands night after
	 night. One day\\\, she stumbles through a hidden door and meets the Libra
	rian: the ageless guardian of the Astral Library\\\, where the desperate a
	nd the lost escape to new lives inside their favorite books. All seems wel
	l until a shadowy enemy emerges and threatens everyone inside. \\nAs dange
	r draws closer\\\, Alix and the Librarian try to escape\\\, fleeing places
	 like the back alleys of the Sherlock Holmes series\\\, the Regency-era dr
	awing rooms of Jane Austen\\\, and the decadent parties of The Great Gatsb

DTSTART:20260221T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered what really goes on in our country’s cri
	minal courts? Many want to believe in the hallowed halls of justice\\\, wi
	th ethical and equitable legal processes that pursue truth and enforce the
	 law fairly. But one author argues that this perception hides the reality 
	that the system is broken. \\nEmily Galvin Almanza\\\, also a former publi
	c defender\\\, presents her latest work The Price of Mercy: Unfair Trials\
	\\, a Violent System\\\, and a Public Defender’s Search for Justice in Ame
	rica. The text takes us behind closed doors of America’s criminal courts\\
	\, arguing that the institutions that claim to protect us are doing the ex
	act opposite. Examples include data showing that jails actually increase f
	uture crime\\\, police corruption in overtime pay\\\, an example of a man 
	incarcerated for decades because scientists mistook dog hair for his own\\
	\, incentives that push prosecutors to seek convictions\\\, and even how j
	udges may decide cases differently after lunch. \\nAlmanza presents exampl
	es and offers a blueprint for fixing these issues at their core\\\, and by
	 engaging the general public in helping to shape our collective future.\n\

SUMMARY:Judith Enck with Bellamy Pailthorp
DTSTAMP:20260221T191204Z
DTSTART:20260222T140000Z
DESCRIPTION:In less than 100 years\\\, plastic has gone from a novel invent
	ion to a ubiquitous feature across the globe. Plastic is now found in ever
	ything from household objects to industrial mechanisms to inside human bod
	ies themselves. Once a marvel of modern science\\\, plastic has become so 
	inextricably woven into our lives that imagining a world without it can se
	em impossible. \\nBacked by years of research and reflections taking place
	 in real time with changing technology and environmental awareness\\\, The
	 Problem with Plastic critically examines the paradox of this material and
	 how swiftly its integration has affected public health and the planet as 
	a whole. The book explores how\\\, despite being first celebrated for its 
	innovations\\\, plastic is now broadly recognized as a leading contributor
	 to environmental pollution at every level\\\, the climate crisis\\\, and 
	building waste levels that disproportionately impact marginalized communit
	ies that bear the brunt of petrochemical pollution. \\nAuthor and environm
	ental policy expert Judith Enck\\\, in collaboration with co-author Adam M
	ahoney and the Beyond Plastics project\\\, strives to draw attention to th
	e alarming extent that microplastics have infiltrated society and the ways
	 consumers can challenge what they think about the roles they can play. Un
	packing illusions about recycling\\\, mechanisms of environmental racism\\
	\, and deceptive greenwashing strategies\\\, the authors emphasize the urg
	ency of calling for real\\\, actionable measures to push against the effec
	ts of the plastics industry. The Problem with Plastic highlights powerful 
	stories of frontline resistance in places like Louisiana\\\, Texas\\\, and
	 Appalachia\\\, and seeks to equip readers with practical tools– including
	 a “Household Waste Audit” to track and reduce plastic consumption and mod
	el policy guides for driving legislative change. Fortified with calls for 
	individual responsibility\\\, citizen action\\\, and governmental regulati
	ons\\\, The Problem with Plastic aims to show that while plastic is a form
	idable problem\\\, coordinated efforts can lead to solutions.\n\nFrom Town

SUMMARY:DUNE Mini-Comics Night
DTSTAMP:20260221T191204Z
DTSTART:20260224T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:DUNE* Mini-Comics Night is where folks are invited to create th
	e contents of a black and white\\\, 5.5” x 8.5” printed anthology within a
	 limited amount of time\\\, in one evening with no prompts or themes. Crea
	te whatever you want but it must be physical and finished by the end of th
	e night. \\nAn exclusive edition of the book will be published and distrib
	uted to only the contributors at the following DUNE meet-up. \\n \\nThis i
	s a night of communal productivity and creation with a deadline\\\, not ju
	st drinking and drawing. It is also meant to be a challenge to one’s abili
	ties to create a finished piece of self-satisfied work within the limitati
	ons. Bring the art supplies and paper that you are most comfortable workin
	g with and join dozens of illustrators and cartoonists on the 4th Tuesday 
	of each month from 5pm – 9pm. Space fills up quickly so be on time or you 
	may have to wait for space to create. \\n \\nAs always\\\, this is a commu
	nity funded project and we’ll ask for donations of $5 per submission for p
	rinting/publishing and renting the space at the historic Hugo House. Pleas
	e do our hosts a favor and order one drink minimum from the Book Bar. \\n 
	\\nAll are welcome! Don’t be a jerk! \\n \\n*There is no relation to DUNE 
	by Frank Herbert\\\, but you are welcome to submit DUNE inspired works. \\
	n \\n4th Tuesday of Each Month 5-9pm \\nHugo House \\n1634 11th Ave\\\, Se
	attle\\\, WA 98122 \\n \\nFree admission to this event is made possible wi
	th support from 4Culture.\n\nFrom Hugo House

SUMMARY:George Conway III
DTSTAMP:20260221T191204Z
DTSTART:20260225T183000Z
DESCRIPTION:This talk will explore the idea that the endurance of the rule 
	of law in the United States relies not solely on the provisions of the Con
	stitution—its structural framework\\\, the institutions it established\\\,
	 or the rights it enshrines—but fundamentally on the character of its citi
	zens. Qualities such as public-spiritedness\\\, tolerance\\\, moderation\\
	\, empathy\\\, mutual respect\\\, a sense of fair play\\\, and\\\, ultimat
	ely\\\, intelligence\\\, honor\\\, and decency form the foundation of cons
	titutional democracy. \\nEchoing Benjamin Franklin’s cautionary remark—“A 
	republic\\\, if you can keep it”—the talk reflects on how the republic now
	 faces one of its most precarious moments. The threat\\\, the speaker cont
	ends\\\, does not stem from any single individual\\\, not even the Preside
	nt of the United States\\\, but rather from the pervasive political disqui
	et within a large segment of the electorate. \\nA change in administration
	 in 2021 did not resolve this underlying ailment\\\, and a future shift in
	 2029 will not remedy it either—unless those who grasp the importance of c
	onstitutionalism and the rule of law can meaningfully convey to others tha
	t the preservation of their rights depends on their willingness to uphold 
	the rights of others. The presentation will conclude with a discussion on 
	whether—and how—such civic understanding can be rekindled.\n\nFrom Town Ha

SUMMARY:Andrew Yang with Jonathan Sposato
DTSTAMP:20260221T191204Z
DTSTART:20260227T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Remember that one time in 2019 when presidential candidate Andr
	ew Yang promised a thousand dollars a month for a whole year to ten U.S. f
	amilies if they donated to his campaign? Yang would like to address this. 
	Pulling from his latest book titled Hey Yang\\\, Where’s My Thousand Bucks
	?\\\, Yang shares stories from his remarkable life so far\\\, including th
	is viral moment during a live presidential debate. \\nBeyond championing u
	niversal basic income\\\, Yang would like to bring a little humor into the
	 world. In his candid and playful accounts\\\, Yang examines where the U.S
	. sits today through the lens of his unexpected journey from entrepreneur 
	to presidential candidate. Part political memoir\\\, part comedy\\\, and p
	art interior monologue\\\, his stories attempt to make complex ideas acces
	sible and entertaining. \\nIt’s this entertainment that he sees as a unify
	ing potential. Yang believes in the power of laughter\\\, even in — and ma
	ybe especially in — trying times. For anyone frustrated with traditional p
	olitical narratives\\\, curious about the human behind the headlines\\\, o
	r simply looking for a light-hearted exploration of trying to improve life
	 in the U.S.\\\, Yang wants to enlighten\\\, entertain\\\, and inspire. It
	’s through this optimism\\\, Yang hopes\\\, that we can create real positi
	ve change.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

DTSTART:20260228T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects

SUMMARY:Lauren Groff with Amber Flame
DTSTAMP:20260221T191204Z
DTSTART:20260301T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Whether you know her from her short stories in The New Yorker o
	r The Atlantic or from one of her bestselling novels\\\, Lauren Groff is a
	rguably one of the leading literary voices in the U.S. Groff will share fr
	om her new collection of short stories\\\, Brawler\\\, which reflects upon
	 humanity’s ceaseless battle between our dark and light angels. \\nRanging
	 from the 1950s to the present day and moving across age\\\, class\\\, and
	 region––from New England to Florida to California––the nine stories in Gr
	off’s newest collection dive into the animal and the divine within us all.
	 \\nThe characters paint a different picture of the same theme: a young wo
	man suddenly responsible for her disabled sibling\; a hot-tempered high sc
	hool swimmer in need of an adult\; a mother blinded by the loss of her fam
	ily\; and a banking successor with a different kind of inheritance. Motiva
	ted by love\\\, challenged by the double edges of other people’s good inte
	ntions\\\, they all try to do the right thing for as long as they can. It’
	s through these stories that Groff illuminates what it means to be human. 
	\\nGroff’s popularity comes from her insight into human nature. Through he
	r various stories\\\, Brawler offers specific turning points in people’s l
	ives\\\, highlighting all of our thin boundaries between love and fear\\\,
	 compassion and violence\\\, reason and instinct\\\, altruism and what it 
	takes to survive.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

DTSTART:20260302T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to the phenomenon that is consciousness\\\, there
	 is one point on which scientists\\\, philosophers\\\, and artists all agr
	ee: it feels like something to be us. Yet the fact that we have a subjecti
	ve experience of the world remains one of nature’s greatest mysteries. How
	 is it that our mental operations are accompanied by feelings\\\, thoughts
	\\\, and a sense of self? What would a scientific investigation of our inn
	er life look like when we have as little distance and perspective on it as
	 fish do of the sea? In A World Appears\\\, Michael Pollan traces the unma
	pped continent that is consciousness\\\, bringing radically different pers
	pectives—scientific\\\, philosophical\\\, literary\\\, spiritual\\\, and p
	sychedelic—to see what each can teach us about this central fact of life.\

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260221T191204Z
DTSTART:20260305T000000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

	zer Prize-winning journalist\\\, wants to remember – and learn from – anot
	her\\\, lesser-known story from World War II. In her book\\\, Safe Passage
	\\\, she reveals the dramatic\\\, behind-the-scenes efforts to bring U.S. 
	and Japanese citizens home from enemy land. \\nIn 1943\\\, during some of 
	the Pacific theater’s bloodiest battles\\\, the United States and Japan co
	ordinated the exchange of civilians caught on the wrong side of the battle
	field after Pearl Harbor. Nearly fifteen hundred Allied civilians trapped 
	in Asia\\\, mostly U.S. citizens\\\, sailed through dangerous waters to In
	dia\\\, where they were traded for Japanese immigrants sent from the U.S. 
	The fate of the more than ten thousand U.S. civilians left behind in Asia 
	rested on the success of this endeavor.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

	eattle films and stories—but the final setlist will emerge from your votes
	. \\nChoose the songs you want to sing on by voting here. \\nYour selectio

	n the room. \\nTown Hall is the perfect home for this gathering—a civic sp
	ace where the people of Seattle come together to express who we are\\\, wh
	ere we come from\\\, and how our stories keep evolving. This night becomes
	 a shared act of remembrance and re-creation\\\, sung by the city itself. 
	\\nNo rehearsals. No sheet music. No choir robes. Just a room full of voic
	es\\\, Seattle pride\\\, and the soundtrack of the city we love—raised tog
	ether in harmony. \\nYou help choose the songs. We become the choir.\n\nFr

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260221T191205Z
DTSTART:20260313T210000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

SUMMARY:American Echoes
DTSTAMP:20260221T191205Z
DTSTART:20260314T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Solstice Symphony Orchestra returns on March 14 with a FREE Sat
	urday evening concert. This performance also marks the debut of Solstice C
	amerata\\\, a new chamber-orchestra ensemble dedicated to repertoire writt
	en for smaller orchestral forces. \\nAdmission is free\; tickets are requi
	red. \\nTitled American Echoes\\\, the concert will explore the “American 
	sound” across time\\\, space\\\, and perspectives. The program opens with 
	Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Symphony No. 25\\\, which was composed the same 
	year that the Boston Tea Party took place in the US (1773)\\\, situating i
	ts urgency and unrest within a wider moment of philosophical and political
	 upheaval. The program then turns to four unique American voices from diff
	erent eras and backgrounds — Charles Ives\\\, Florence Price\\\, Caroline 
	Shaw\\\, and Aaron Copland — whose music engages with shared themes of dou
	bt and devotion\\\, inheritance and reinvention\\\, intimacy and expansive
	ness. \\nPerformed by a reduced ensemble in a chamber-orchestra setting\\\
	, American Echoes invites close listening and rewards reflection. Admissio
	n is free and open to all\; tickets are required and will be available in 
	advance. \\nThis program is supported\\\, in part\\\, by a grant from the 
	Washington State Arts Commission.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

DTSTART:20260314T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:Creating a good monitor mix is one of the most important tasks 
	for a live sound engineer to achieve. This advanced class will introduce y
	ou to digital mixing boards in a low pressure environment. Subjects will i
	nclude an introduction to Vera’s stage monitors\, the basic ‘ringing out’ 
	of monitors\, EQing\, and setting levels. The use of these techniques will
	 allow you to create a clear monitor mix that will help performers be at t
	heir best. After a person has completed the Mixing for Monitors class they
	 are eligible to take on Monitor Engineer volunteer positions at Vera show
	s. Students must complete Live Sound 101 to be eligible for this class.\n\
	nThis class is a prerequisite for the Front of House Mixing class at Vera 
	and Monitor Engineer shifts at Vera Project shows. Each Live Sound class u
	nlocks new audio engineering volunteer shifts at Vera and eventually paid 
	opportunities in and outside of the venue. Become a volunteer at Vera to a
	ccess other audio-related educational programs such as tours\, field trips
	\, and internships.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

DESCRIPTION:Do you own an iPhone or other Apple product? If you don’t\\\, c
	hances are that you know someone who does. Although the present ubiquity o
	f Apple is well-known\\\, how much do you know about its past? Just in tim
	e for Apple’s 50th anniversary\\\, author and CBS correspondent David Pogu
	e tells the history of the iconic company: how it was born\\\, nearly died
	\\\, and was revived under the legendary Steve Jobs\\\, and how it later b
	ecame the most valuable company in the world. \\nOn April 1\\\, 1976\\\, t
	wo men in their 20s\\\, both named Steve\\\, founded a modest startup. The
	ir goal was to bring the power of computers to everyone. Over the next fiv
	e decades\\\, Apple revolutionized the tech landscape\\\, introducing the 
	public to many products that we use today and marrying technology with des
	ign. \\nWith in-depth research and illustrations\\\, Apple: The First 50 Y
	ears includes new interviews with 150 key figures\\\, including Steve Wozn
	iak\\\, John Sculley\\\, Jony Ive\\\, and many current engineers\\\, execu
	tives\\\, and designers. Stories of frenetic all-nighters\\\, creative reb
	ellion\\\, and innovation offer readers a backstage look the titanic succe
	sses (450 million iPods\\\, 700 million iPads\\\, 2.2 billion iPhones) and
	 colossal failures (Lisa\\\, Apple III\\\, MobileMe) that mark a half cent
	ury of Apple devices. Pogue’s book also attempts to dispel myths\\\, clari
	fying the past and evaluating Apple’s position in the future as it enters 
	the next 50 years.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

DESCRIPTION:As we cascade further into the digital age\\\, concerns over pr

	icial intelligence expands its reach\\\, vast aggregates of personal data 
	are constantly being mined to refine future models. But\\\, the fight for

	: My Thirty-Year Fight Against Digital Surveillance\\\, author and Digital
	 Rights Activist\\\, Cindy Cohn\\\, chronicles her career-long battle to p
	reserve our right to privacy online. \\nPart memoir and part legal history
	 for a general audience\\\, Privacy’s Defender reminds the reader just how
	 hard-won the privacy rights we enjoy today were. Cohn stresses the societ
	al importance of digital privacy\\\, citing its role in combatting authori
	tarianism\\\, organizing public protests\\\, and reinforcing other human r
	ights as well.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260221T191205Z
DTSTART:20260317T230000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

DESCRIPTION:At a moment when national politics are testing the boundaries o

	sking a vital question: What can we do to protect one another? \\nJoin Tow
	n Hall Seattle and The Stranger for the March 19 edition of the Speaking o
	f Seattle civic conversation series\\\, an evening focused on immigrant ri
	ghts\\\, community responsibility\\\, and the everyday actions that help s
	afeguard our neighbors. \\nThis timely conversation will explore how feder
	al immigration enforcement policies ripple through local communities — and
	 how ordinary people can respond with care\\\, courage\\\, and solidarity.
	 Together\\\, we’ll examine what it means to treat immigrant rights as hum
	an rights\\\, and how community members can act lawfully\\\, safely\\\, an
	d effectively when confronted with fear-based tactics and unconstitutional
	 overreach.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260221T191205Z
DTSTART:20260328T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

	lease note that each performance day will present various works from the I
	nsidious Trilogy. The complete Trilogy performs over five days in a 2-act 
	or 3-act rotating repertory format: Wed. May 20\, 2026: Strange Fruit\, Gr
	ief (two acts) Thur. May 21\, 2026: Strange Fruit\, Targeted (two acts) Fr
