SUMMARY:*SOLD OUT* KEXP/Sonic Reducer & Clock-Out Lounge Present: The Briefs w/ The Drowns\, The Coolers
DESCRIPTION:KEXP/Sonic Reducer & Clock-Out Lounge Present: The Briefs The DrownsThe Coolers Saturday March 7th8:30 doors 21+$22adv/$25doshttps://thebriefs.bandcamp.com/musicHitting their 25 year anniversary and forever moving forward\, THE BRIEFS have been busy in 2024/2025 playing packed shows to both sides of the pond\, releasing new singles on TKO Records\, rereleasing back catalogue and keeping their feet firmly planted on the sticky punk rock floor from where they started. THE BRIEFS live shows continue to ignite crowds\, reaffirming their status as punk rock stalwarts. Theirrelentless touring and dynamic performances have garnered the band a fierce following that spans decades– and fads.This quarter-century of mayhem traces back to the bands unlikely start: Like a scud missile from outer space\, their debut album Hit After Hit set out to destroy thenew Millenniums flaccid alt-rock scene in 2000and\, in turninspired two decades of raucous radioactive fallout. Sewing together a tattered tapestry of 70s-style punkwith a nod toward Dangerhouse Records\, DEVO\, Thrasher Magazine\, and ABBAtheyve urged countless kids to grab a junk guitar\, a pair of second-hand sunglasses\, and a bottle of peroxide. What started with four idiot savants in a downtown Seattle basement has led to a remarkable ride\, spawning some of the catchiest anti-hits this side of Y2K. Off the Charts\,Sex Objects and Steal Yer Heart are more than essential punk classicsthey may have aided in reversing punks once terminal diagnosis. Whats next? THE BRIEFS legacy has proven to be as sticky as industrial hold hairspray. A mid-2000s hiatussaw members forming side projects like Sharp Objects\, The Cute Lepers\, and Suspect Parts\, but all roads led back to THE BRIEFS. Following their Singles Only box set and Odd Numbers\, demos and rarities release\, 2018 album Platinum Rats proved the band to be as vital as ever (a US tour with the legendary Dead Boys followed). For this unstoppable force\, the radiation is still in the water andgood news for our speciesthe punk rock mutations are alive and kicking. After 25 years\, THE BRIEFS are still weird\, still wired.https://thedrowns.bandcamp.com/https://thecoolers253.bandcamp.com/

SUMMARY:Clock-Out Lounge Presents: The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis
DESCRIPTION:Clock-Out Lounge Presents: The Messthetics and James Brandon LewisDeface the Currency TourSat April 18thDoors 8:3021+$22adv/$25doshttps://themessthetics.bandcamp.com/album/the-messthetics-and-james-brandon-lewisDeface the Currency\, the new second collaborative album from the Messthetics andJames Brandon Lewis\, grew out of a simple intuition. The group with saxophonistLewis joining the core Messthetics lineup of Brendan Canty on drums\, Joe Lally on bass and Anthony Pirog on guitar was on tour in the summer of 2025 when Canty knew it was time to go back into the studio. This configuration of the band had debuted on record the year prior\, releasing an acclaimed self-titled album via Impulse!\, the legendary jazz label. But as the quartet logged serious time on the road\, the drummer felt their chemistry evolving\, so he called up engineer Don Godwin and booked a couple of days at Tonal Park in Takoma Park\, Maryland\, where The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis was recorded.Deface the Currency preserves the tightness and variety of its predecessor\, but across the albums seven tracks\, it reveals new levels of confidence and risk. On pieces such as the title track named after a quote from Greek philosopher Diogenes that speaks to challenging societal norms and a new version of Serpent Tongue\, which first appeared on the Messthetics self-titled 2018 debut\, the quartet reaches ecstatic peaks that convey fun as much as ferocity. More than any earlier statement by the band\, the record seamlessly melds the sounds that make up its collective DNA\, from punk rock to free jazz and funk\, balancing compositional precision with palpable improvisational fire.
