	st raised between cultures\, brings a hypnotic\, cinematic presence that f
	uses psychedelic pop\, dreamlike visuals\, and bilingual storytelling. Her
	 work explores identity\, intuition\, and self-discovery\, pairing etherea
	l production with striking lyricism that resonates across borders.Together
	\, maye and Ambar Lucid create a shared live experience that feels intimat
	e\, immersive\, and emotionally charged. This tour is not about spectacle 
	for spectacles sake\, but about connection. Two artists\, two worlds\, and

	singular and unforgettable.\nAll sales are final. There are no refunds unl
