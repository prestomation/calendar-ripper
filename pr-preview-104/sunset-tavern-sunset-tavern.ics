SUMMARY:Bitchin Bajas\, Geologist
DTSTAMP:20260222T201901Z
DTSTART:20260223T040000Z
DESCRIPTION:Advance: $18 ($23.18 after fees)\n\nDay of: $23 ($29.36 after f
	ees)\n\nBitchin Bajas:\n\nThe next album from Bitchin Bajas — the trio of 
	Cooper Crain\, Rob Frye and Daniel Quinlivan — is near! The successor to 2
	022’s Bajascillators glides easily into frame\, but once there\, Inland Se
	e is deceptively immediate: four songs\, entirely within themselves\, all 
	together forming an essential whole. Inland See is out September 26\; the 
	lead single "Skylarking" arrives today with a new visualizer featuring vis
	uals by Nick Ciontea.\n\nWith every successive Bitchin Bajas release\, we 
	see that the real key for them is a sense of discovery\, that tingle that 
	comes when you feel something breaking through. The sky opening up. Take "
	Skylarking": a remarkable construction\, built to and fro in the ether\, b
	ut with a deceptive grasp of four-on-the-floor rhythm. A space dance that 
	achieves completion in almost aggressive terms — aggressive like an oxygen
	 bath! — showcasing jewels from their world music and jazz archives\, then
	 returning to their undulous source drone\, riding smoothly back into sile
	nce. The stuff that fills this Inland See holds you up powerfully\, as if 
	you’re floating\, saltwater or helium-wise — effervescent\, effortless\, e
	lemental.\n\nThis music was mostly written on the road. It’s an unusual ha
	ppening for Bitchin Bajas! They were open for it\, though — the landmarked
	 Bajascillators kept them out there for a while\, and when inspiration str
	uck\, there they're rolling. When it was time to render it to tape and fin
	d the record there\, they did the whole thing at Electrical Audio\, record
	ed in Studio B by Cooper. Recording all together in the room there lent a 
	sense of space\, which they dug and captured as natural as possible. No re
	verb at all added after the fact. Some additional recording and mixing was
	 done at home by the Bajas\, then Phil Baljeu did up the art. Soon enough\
	, Inland See is flowing toward you\, through the hi-fi — and you'll feel i
	t all in the air.

	sruptors. ILUKA isn’t afraid to be outspoken\, share her feelings\, let ou

	y disarmingly catchy songcraft and a bewitching aesthetic.\n\nPlease note\

	d does not accept vertical ID’s for entry.\n\nLiz Cooper:\n\nThe thing abo
	ut finding yourself is there's always another corner to turn. The Vermont-
	based singer/songwriter Liz Cooper made her third album during a period of
	 intense self-discovery and reinvention. She moved to New York for the fir
	st time\, weathered a pandemic\, came out to herself after falling in love
	 with a friend\, and experienced her first queer relationship and breakup\
	, all in the course of a few years. New Day marks both a personal and a mu
	sical revolution for Cooper – a plunge into psychedelic pop depths and a f
	ullhearted reflection of a whirlwind chapter in her life. These songs scin
	tillate with the kind of self-confidence that only beams through after you
	've aimed a sharp gaze inward and realized that whatever you see will alwa
	ys keep darting ahead of you.

	ike old New York revivicated and remixed. “It showcases all of us\, all of
	 our different personalities\,” says bassist/vocalist Zane Acord. “In The 
	Thing\, we’re a collective band. We hang our hats on being a true band — w
	here we all have the spotlight. I think that gives us a different edge.” T
	hat album follows 2023’s debut\, Here’s the Thing\, and The Things Is\, wh
	ich dropped the following year.\n\nThe four members of Thing came from int
	ersecting backgrounds\, lending to their rock-and-roll-as-melting-pot vibe
	. Acord grew up with a drummer dad who hipped him to bands like Led Zeppel
	in and Grand Funk Railroad\; he met guitarist/vocals Michael Carter — an a
	vid Beatles fan — in middle school. The duo went on to collect Bradley in 
	high school\, an aspiring producer with a studio in his basement and a yen
	 for psych rock. Jazz drummer Lucas Ebeling linked up with the band when e
	veryone found their way to New York in 2022. They’ve since played more tha
	n 300 shows across the world.\n\nThe band’s self-titled work\, then\, is a
	 culmination of all those influences — and all that hustle. “We threw all 
	of our different various influences throughout — all the decades of rock a
	nd roll and adjacent genres — and ended up with something of our own\,” Br
	adley says. “Our contribution to the genre. Our style. Our… thing.”

DESCRIPTION:Moved from Madame Lou's\n\nAdvance: $29.50 ($38.11 after fees)\
	n\nDay of: $32 ($40.69 after fees)\n\nWesterman:\n\nWesterman is a London-
	born\, Athens-based artist and songwriter signed to Partisan Records. Know
	n for his thoughtful lyrics and genre-fluid sound\, he has earned critical
	 acclaim across two full-length albums and multiple EPs\, with support fro
	m Pitchfork\, Rolling Stone\, The Guardian\, Stereogum\, NPR Music + more.
	\n\nAfter building early momentum with a series of singles and the Ark EP 
	(2018)\, Westerman released his debut album Your Hero Is Not Dead in 2020.
	 Produced with long-time collaborator Bullion (Nathan Jenkins)\, the album
	 was recorded between Southern Portugal and London and received widespread
	 critical praise. Pitchfork described the album as “excellent\,” highlight
	ing its fusion of soft rock\, ambient textures\, and lyrical introspection
	. Key tracks included “Blue Comanche\,” “Think I’ll Stay\,” and the title 
	track\, all of which received strong playlisting and airplay support acros
	s DSPs and BBC Radio.\n\nIn 2023\, Westerman returned with his sophomore L
	P An Inbuilt Fault\, co-produced with Big Thief’s James Krivchenia. The al
	bum marked a sonic departure\, incorporating more live instrumentation\, p
	olyrhythmic structures\, and raw vocal delivery. It was developed\n\ndurin
	g sessions in Los Angeles with a circle of experimental musicians and mixe
	d by Krivchenia\, expanding Westerman’s palette into more emotionally dyna
	mic territory. The lead single “CSI: Petralona” was praised by Office Maga
	zine and Stereogum\, and accompanied by international touring\, including 
	sold out headline shows in NYC\, LA\, Chicago\, and London.\n\nAcross his 
	career\, Westerman has been featured in The New York Times\, The FADER\, a
	nd Clash\, and has performed at key festivals including End of the Road an
	d Primavera. His visual collaborations with renowned graphic designer Bráu
	lio Amado have been widely recognized\, forming a consistent visual identi
	ty across releases.\n\nWesterman will release another new album in 2025\, 
	more details on that to come!

	\nRDGLDGRN:\n\nRDGLDGRN have always been about the blending of worlds. Eve
	n their name stems from the merging of its member’s diverse influences and
	 personalities\, each represented by a corresponding color - Red (Guitar)\
	, Gold (Bass) and Green (Vocals). On LP3\, they’ve managedto set a new bar
	 for how contrasting sounds can come together. With that being said\, it’s
	 no surprise that it is also the record they’ve had the most control over.
	 After learning the many lessons of navigating the major label system over
	 the past six years\, the band will be releasing LP3 on their own label\, 
	Deuce Day World. It is an album that the band feels finally captures the i
	dea RDGLDGRN was based. “Everyone views us in a different way\,” Green add
	s\, “and in the past that has defined our music. On LP3\, the music captur
	es exactly how we see ourselves”.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a

	on their laurels\, never taking themselves too seriously\, while always pu
	tting their souls into the music. They have won the hearts of anyone that 
	has experienced their live shows\, and have garnered a cultlike following 
	in their native Ireland\, the UK and most recently mainland Europe and Nor
	th America.

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($26.27 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($31.42 after f
	ees)\n\nAlela Diane:\n\nMore than a decade into one of contemporary folk’s
	 most quietly extraordinary careers\, Alela Diane returns on May 22 with W
	ho's Keeping Time? via Fluff & Gravy / Loose Music.\n\nThe Portland songwr
	iter’s seventh full-length album came as the consequence of intuition\, co
	incidence\, and community. On the first of April last year\, Michael Hurle
	y\, folk legend and indispensable presence in the Portland music scene\, d
	ied at the age of eighty-three. “I was absolutely gutted\,” says Alela\, w
	ho didn’t just revere Hurley but knew him well. She performed in a tribute
	 show for Hurley\, and in that collective mourning\, found solace and insp
	iration. “It was an epiphany to realize how much I missed my community. I 
	felt very clear about what I wanted in that moment—I want to be alive. I w
	ant to see live music. I want to play it.”\n\nThough she’d taken the solo 
	route on her last handful of releases\, Alela was interested in a new way 
	forward. Plucking the day away in the attic of her 1892 Victorian home\, s
	he found new songs flickering in the dusty light—and a desire to play them
	 with people.\n\nAlela met drummer Danny Austin-Manning at Clay Street Stu
	dios one night and he introduced her to co-producer Sam Weber (Madison Cun
	ningham\, Anna Tivel). Along with Sebastian Owens on bass\, they recorded 
	fifteen songs in less than five days—all live in the very attic where she 
	wrote them. Anna Tivel contributed backing vocals and violin. Peter Lalish
	\, of the band Lucius\, added guitar. Fellow Pacific Northwesterners Kati 
	Claborn and Luke Ydstie of Blind Pilot and AC Sapphire provided overdubs o
	f all kinds. Alela’s vision for uninhibited music and revived\, creative k
	inship thrust her into a new season.\n\nThe result is an 11-track set rang
	ing from lulling to raw to cinematic\, with Alela’s mellifluous voice a li
	vely and affecting instrument throughout. The lyrics reveal an artist with
	 the particular kind of strength required to face pain without getting los
	t—an ability Alela has honed over a lifetime of songwriting\, during which
	 her lustrous discography has garnered major critical acclaim from the lik
	es of Pitchfork\, NPR Music\, The Guardian\, and plenty more. UNCUT has ch
	aracterized her skill as “insanely beautiful\, with the strength and delic
	acy of spider silk” while counting her work among the ‘50 best singer-song
	writer albums’ of all time—a canon comprising John Lennon\, Joni Mitchell\
	, Joan Baez\, and Paul Simon. Consequence has echoed that significance\, d
	eclaring\, “Hers is a timeless sound\, that of a wayfaring troubadour\, wh
	ich only seems to come a few times a generation.”\n\nWith Who’s Keeping Ti
	me?\, Alela Diane transforms grief into gathering\, reaffirming her place 
	as a vital\, living force in contemporary folk music—rooted in community\,
	 presence\, and the enduring power of song.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Ta

	\, Mariel Buckley has planted her flag firmly as a songwriter who’s in it
