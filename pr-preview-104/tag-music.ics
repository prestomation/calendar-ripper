DTSTART:20260222T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260222T201905Z
DTSTART:20260222T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

DTSTAMP:20260222T201905Z
DTSTART:20260223T040000Z
DESCRIPTION:Advance: $18 ($23.18 after fees)\n\nDay of: $23 ($29.36 after f
	ees)\n\nBitchin Bajas:\n\nThe next album from Bitchin Bajas — the trio of 
	Cooper Crain\, Rob Frye and Daniel Quinlivan — is near! The successor to 2
	022’s Bajascillators glides easily into frame\, but once there\, Inland Se
	e is deceptively immediate: four songs\, entirely within themselves\, all 
	together forming an essential whole. Inland See is out September 26\; the 
	lead single "Skylarking" arrives today with a new visualizer featuring vis
	uals by Nick Ciontea.\n\nWith every successive Bitchin Bajas release\, we 
	see that the real key for them is a sense of discovery\, that tingle that 
	comes when you feel something breaking through. The sky opening up. Take "
	Skylarking": a remarkable construction\, built to and fro in the ether\, b
	ut with a deceptive grasp of four-on-the-floor rhythm. A space dance that 
	achieves completion in almost aggressive terms — aggressive like an oxygen
	 bath! — showcasing jewels from their world music and jazz archives\, then
	 returning to their undulous source drone\, riding smoothly back into sile
	nce. The stuff that fills this Inland See holds you up powerfully\, as if 
	you’re floating\, saltwater or helium-wise — effervescent\, effortless\, e
	lemental.\n\nThis music was mostly written on the road. It’s an unusual ha
	ppening for Bitchin Bajas! They were open for it\, though — the landmarked
	 Bajascillators kept them out there for a while\, and when inspiration str
	uck\, there they're rolling. When it was time to render it to tape and fin
	d the record there\, they did the whole thing at Electrical Audio\, record
	ed in Studio B by Cooper. Recording all together in the room there lent a 
	sense of space\, which they dug and captured as natural as possible. No re
	verb at all added after the fact. Some additional recording and mixing was
	 done at home by the Bajas\, then Phil Baljeu did up the art. Soon enough\
	, Inland See is flowing toward you\, through the hi-fi — and you'll feel i
	t all in the air.\n\nFrom Sunset Tavern

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DTSTAMP:20260222T201905Z
DTSTART:20260223T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

DTSTART:20260224T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260222T201905Z
DTSTART:20260224T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

DTSTART:20260225T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re

	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260226T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

DTSTART:20260227T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260227T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

DTSTART:20260228T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

DTSTART:20260228T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260301T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260301T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem

DTSTART:20260301T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re

	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera

	honesty — a quality that has defined her as one of alt-pop’s most vital di
	sruptors. ILUKA isn’t afraid to be outspoken\, share her feelings\, let ou
	t a little rage\, or get weird. This unabashed honesty underscores her art
	istry as she stretches the boundaries of pop with blunt lyrics sweetened b
	y disarmingly catchy songcraft and a bewitching aesthetic.\n\nPlease note\

DTSTART:20260302T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260302T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

	 Charismatic leaders. These are the dictators\, demagogues and false idols
	 who\, around the world at this very moment\, are stoking division and ign
	iting war in the name of nothing but self-gain. They’re also the unmistaka
	ble target of Wheel’s latest album of the same name: a seven-song prog met
	al opus that strives for all things right in a world gone wrong. Since for
	ming in 2015\, Wheel have swiftly grown from underdogs of Helsinki\, Finla
	nd\, to an international tour de force. The angular riffs\, unforgettable 
	melodies and adventurous scope of the trio’s 2019 debut\, Moving Backwards
	\, was instantly adored by fans of megastars from Tool to Coheed & Cambria
	. Then\, 2021 follow up Resident Human received rave reviews from publicat
	ions across the planet\, praising its sonic evolution and bravely dystopia
	n themes. Charismatic Leaders was meticulously crafted to meet Wheel’s eve
	r-heightening benchmarks. Its songs date as far back as 2020\,and recordin
	g with engineers/co-producers Daniel Bergstrand and Fredrik Thordendal \\(
	Meshuggah\\) stretched from August to December 2023. The end result\, mixe
	d by Forrester Savell\, has consolidated all the gains of what came before
	: singer/guitarist James Lascelles\, lead guitarist Jussi Turunen\, bassis
	t Jere Lehto and drummer Santeri Saksala’s third album represents their he
	aviest and most conscious music to date. Already\, Wheel have toured the w
	orld with such prog metal idols as Epica\, Leprous\, Vola and Soen\, and i
	t’s easy to imagine the irresistible hook of “Disciple” or the explosive g
	uitars of “Submission” only amplifying the excitement of their shows. Whee
	l’s The Dark Side Tour 2026 will take fans deep into the band’s musical un
	iverse\, showcasing songs rarely heard on stage next to classics from thei
	r catalogue. Wheel will revive hidden gems\, creating an intense and immer
	sive live experience. This tour promises a unique journey for longtime fol
	lowers and a thrilling discovery for newcomers alike Accessibility Disclai

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260303T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260303T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260304T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260304T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260304T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

	r Screen Printing 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at 
	Open Sessions: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press
	 for shirts\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just scree
	n preparation. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are lookin

	fied when a ticket becomes available. For Open Sessions\, Vera provides: -
	 Rentable screens - Emulsion and emulsion remover - Squegees - Basic tools
	 like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc. Participants must provide their own:
	 - Substrate \\(paper\, t-shirts\, etc\\) - Water based ink Vera \\*does n

	is not set up to safely process non-water based ink. If you have any quest
	ions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org. \\*\\*FAQ\\*\\* 1. Can Vera p
	rint a transparent stencil for me? Yes — You must send us your stencil at 
	least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF\
	, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edit
	s to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when
	 you arrive. If you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Ver
	a\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print ser
	vice location. 2. What if I need direct assistance on my projects? Our mod
	erators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the SP 101 class 
	offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advice on your p
	roject\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. If you have 
	a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please reach out to m
	att@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring. 3. I really want to us
	e your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no slots available? O
	ur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our Open Session is sold 
	out — We have limited space in the studio and several events every day at 
	Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time for Open Sessions. 
	If you're interested in booking the studio outside of Open Sessions\, plea
	se email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private rental rates and avail
	ability.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260305T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260305T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

DTSTART:20260306T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

DTSTART:20260306T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light invites you to become par
	t of the art. Agha\, a Pakistani American artist\, animates spaces with he
	r large-scale sculptural installations. Suspended from the ceiling\, Agha’
	s steel cubes are laser-cut with intricate designs that project geometric 
	shadows onto the visitor. She draws on both the light and dark of her own 
	life\, using South Asian art practices to convey the gender discrimination
	 she faced growing up as a young girl in Pakistan. An in-depth exploration
	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh
	ibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history. Agha is c
	arving a name out for herself in the art world—visit the Seattle Asian Art
	 Museum for an immersive and illuminating experience.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - A

DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260306T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

DESCRIPTION:Before he was a legend\, Bruce Lee was just a young man trying

	ching story follows the Young Dragon as he navigates a new country and fin
	ds his voice. Through movement\, magic\, and heart\, we meet the human beh
	ind the icon—flawed\, fierce\, and full of possibility. Watch as Lee learn
	s to clear his brain by mimicking the white noise of water and begins fusi
	ng martial arts with philosophy. From street fights in Hong Kong to teachi
	ng self-defense and chasing big dreams\, Bruce’s journey reminds us that f
	inding your way means first figuring out who you are. Come see how Seattle
	 shaped him into a flexible\, fluid\, and flowing master—and how he reshap
	ed the world.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260313T210000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

SUMMARY:LS 202: Mixing for Monitors
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260314T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:Creating a good monitor mix is one of the most important tasks 
	for a live sound engineer to achieve. This advanced class will introduce y
	ou to digital mixing boards in a low pressure environment. Subjects will i
	nclude an introduction to Vera’s stage monitors\, the basic ‘ringing out’ 
	of monitors\, EQing\, and setting levels. The use of these techniques will
	 allow you to create a clear monitor mix that will help performers be at t
	heir best. After a person has completed the Mixing for Monitors class they
	 are eligible to take on Monitor Engineer volunteer positions at Vera show
	s. Students must complete Live Sound 101 to be eligible for this class.\n\
	nThis class is a prerequisite for the Front of House Mixing class at Vera 
	and Monitor Engineer shifts at Vera Project shows. Each Live Sound class u
	nlocks new audio engineering volunteer shifts at Vera and eventually paid 
	opportunities in and outside of the venue. Become a volunteer at Vera to a
	ccess other audio-related educational programs such as tours\, field trips
	\, and internships.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260317T230000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

DESCRIPTION:Son Littles live show brings his music into a different kind of
	 clarity- raw\, expressive\, and always evolving. Whether solo or with a f
	ull band\, he moves fluidly between deep grooves\, stripped-down intimacy\
	, and moments that feel completely improvised yet emotionally precise. Its
	 a performance style shaped by instinct and connection\, grounded in the r
	ichness of his voice and the depth of his songwriting.Over the past decade
	\, hes cultivated a sound that draws from soul\, blues\, folk\, hip-hop\, 
	and Rs not just a setlist - its an experience.Following a run through the 
	UK and Europe supporting Larkin Poe\, Son Little is back with a new wave o
	f music and a fresh stretch of tour dates for winter and spring. His new a
	lbum CITYFOLK is set for release in March 2026\, with recent singles in or
	bit and be better offering a first look at whats to come - both onstage an
	d beyond in the months ahead.\nThis event is 21 and over. Any ticket holde
	r unable to present valid identification indicating that they are at least
	 21 years of age will not be admitted to this event\, and will not be elig
	ible for a refund. This ticket is for admission to a live music venue. It 
	provides the holder to observe a musical performance and nothing else. Oth

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($26.27 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($31.42 after f
	ees)\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ bar and venue an
	d does not accept vertical ID’s for entry.\n\nLiz Cooper:\n\nThe thing abo
	ut finding yourself is there's always another corner to turn. The Vermont-
	based singer/songwriter Liz Cooper made her third album during a period of
	 intense self-discovery and reinvention. She moved to New York for the fir
	st time\, weathered a pandemic\, came out to herself after falling in love
	 with a friend\, and experienced her first queer relationship and breakup\
	, all in the course of a few years. New Day marks both a personal and a mu
	sical revolution for Cooper – a plunge into psychedelic pop depths and a f
	ullhearted reflection of a whirlwind chapter in her life. These songs scin
	tillate with the kind of self-confidence that only beams through after you
	've aimed a sharp gaze inward and realized that whatever you see will alwa
	ys keep darting ahead of you.\n\nFrom Sunset Tavern

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260222T201906Z
DTSTART:20260328T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nFrom The Vera Project

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($28.33 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($33.48 after f
	ees)\n\nThe Thing:\n\nWhat is The Thing? It’s a New York band\, sure\, but
	 it’s also an ethos. A return to rock & roll’s roots — to garage bands toi
	ling between the family minivans\, to groups like the Beatles and their un
	ique alchemy\, to tape machines and live band recordings instead of slick 
	studios and myriad songwriters. “We've kind of adapted the ethos of: with 
	restriction comes creativity — old becomes new. And throughout every part 
	of the process that remains true\,” says guitarist/vocalist Jack Bradley.\
	n\nNever is that more apparent than on their self-titled third record\, ou
	t August 6th on their own label. A rough and tumble suite of 12 songs that
	 nods to everyone from The Kinks to The White Stripes\, The Thing sounds l
	ike old New York revivicated and remixed. “It showcases all of us\, all of
	 our different personalities\,” says bassist/vocalist Zane Acord. “In The 
	Thing\, we’re a collective band. We hang our hats on being a true band — w
	here we all have the spotlight. I think that gives us a different edge.” T
	hat album follows 2023’s debut\, Here’s the Thing\, and The Things Is\, wh
	ich dropped the following year.\n\nThe four members of Thing came from int
	ersecting backgrounds\, lending to their rock-and-roll-as-melting-pot vibe
	. Acord grew up with a drummer dad who hipped him to bands like Led Zeppel
	in and Grand Funk Railroad\; he met guitarist/vocals Michael Carter — an a
	vid Beatles fan — in middle school. The duo went on to collect Bradley in 
	high school\, an aspiring producer with a studio in his basement and a yen
	 for psych rock. Jazz drummer Lucas Ebeling linked up with the band when e
	veryone found their way to New York in 2022. They’ve since played more tha
	n 300 shows across the world.\n\nThe band’s self-titled work\, then\, is a
	 culmination of all those influences — and all that hustle. “We threw all 
	of our different various influences throughout — all the decades of rock a
	nd roll and adjacent genres — and ended up with something of our own\,” Br
	adley says. “Our contribution to the genre. Our style. Our… thing.”\n\nFro

DTSTAMP:20260222T201907Z
DTSTART:20260409T033000Z
DESCRIPTION:Moved from Madame Lou's\n\nAdvance: $29.50 ($38.11 after fees)\
	n\nDay of: $32 ($40.69 after fees)\n\nWesterman:\n\nWesterman is a London-
	born\, Athens-based artist and songwriter signed to Partisan Records. Know
	n for his thoughtful lyrics and genre-fluid sound\, he has earned critical
	 acclaim across two full-length albums and multiple EPs\, with support fro
	m Pitchfork\, Rolling Stone\, The Guardian\, Stereogum\, NPR Music + more.
	\n\nAfter building early momentum with a series of singles and the Ark EP 
	(2018)\, Westerman released his debut album Your Hero Is Not Dead in 2020.
	 Produced with long-time collaborator Bullion (Nathan Jenkins)\, the album
	 was recorded between Southern Portugal and London and received widespread
	 critical praise. Pitchfork described the album as “excellent\,” highlight
	ing its fusion of soft rock\, ambient textures\, and lyrical introspection
	. Key tracks included “Blue Comanche\,” “Think I’ll Stay\,” and the title 
	track\, all of which received strong playlisting and airplay support acros
	s DSPs and BBC Radio.\n\nIn 2023\, Westerman returned with his sophomore L
	P An Inbuilt Fault\, co-produced with Big Thief’s James Krivchenia. The al
	bum marked a sonic departure\, incorporating more live instrumentation\, p
	olyrhythmic structures\, and raw vocal delivery. It was developed\n\ndurin
	g sessions in Los Angeles with a circle of experimental musicians and mixe
	d by Krivchenia\, expanding Westerman’s palette into more emotionally dyna
	mic territory. The lead single “CSI: Petralona” was praised by Office Maga
	zine and Stereogum\, and accompanied by international touring\, including 
	sold out headline shows in NYC\, LA\, Chicago\, and London.\n\nAcross his 
	career\, Westerman has been featured in The New York Times\, The FADER\, a
	nd Clash\, and has performed at key festivals including End of the Road an
	d Primavera. His visual collaborations with renowned graphic designer Bráu
	lio Amado have been widely recognized\, forming a consistent visual identi
	ty across releases.\n\nWesterman will release another new album in 2025\, 
	more details on that to come!\n\nFrom Sunset Tavern

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $25 ($31.93 after fees)\n\nDay of: $30 ($37.08 after f
	ees)\n\nJarv:\n\nBrooklyn-based MC / Producer\, Jarv started making music 
	in 2009 and put out his first official release "Jarvage Vol.1" in 2016. He
	 has since released four full-length projects in his modern yet classic bo
	om-bap style. He has garnered millions of streams and YouTube views and ha
	s toured with the likes of RA The Rugged Man\, Masta Ace\, Little Stranger
	\, Mr. Lif & Akrobatik\, Sadat X\, Spose\, The Palmer Squares and so on.\n
	\nRDGLDGRN:\n\nRDGLDGRN have always been about the blending of worlds. Eve
	n their name stems from the merging of its member’s diverse influences and
	 personalities\, each represented by a corresponding color - Red (Guitar)\
	, Gold (Bass) and Green (Vocals). On LP3\, they’ve managedto set a new bar
	 for how contrasting sounds can come together. With that being said\, it’s
	 no surprise that it is also the record they’ve had the most control over.
	 After learning the many lessons of navigating the major label system over
	 the past six years\, the band will be releasing LP3 on their own label\, 
	Deuce Day World. It is an album that the band feels finally captures the i
	dea RDGLDGRN was based. “Everyone views us in a different way\,” Green add
	s\, “and in the past that has defined our music. On LP3\, the music captur
	es exactly how we see ourselves”.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a 
	strictly 21+ bar and venue and does not accept vertical ID’s for entry.\n\

DTSTAMP:20260222T201907Z
DTSTART:20260415T030000Z
DESCRIPTION:Ten years ago before earning gold records\, Logan toured in his
	 89 station wagon named Glenn and developed a devoted following of fans ac
	ross the country that loved his unique and relatable experience of crowd-s
	ourced touring. This spring as an homage to how Logan toured in his statio
	n wagon\, weve rebooted the Glenn tour for one last ride. Over his nearly 
	two-decade career\, Logan has risen as a top independent artist\, bending 
	the country genre with his unique heartland rock sound and racking up over
	 500 million streams. Hes shared the stage with legendary acts including E
	ric Church\, Jamey Johnson\, Sawyer Brown\, Wade Bowen and many more. Loga
	ns singles Better Off Gone and Grew Apart have both earned RIAA Gold certi
	fication. Logans next full-length record Cottonwood Falls will be released
	 this spring.\nThis event is 21 and over. Any ticket holder unable to pres
	ent valid identification indicating that they are at least 21 years of age
	 will not be admitted to this event\, and will not be eligible for a refun
	d. This ticket is for admission to a live music venue. It provides the hol
	der to observe a musical performance and nothing else. Other goods and ser
	vices may be purchased once inside the venue. Please note\, seating is lim
	ited and is available on a first come\, first served basis.\nPrice: $25.08

	ry Re-issue and West Coast Tour\n\nSome of the best records are those that
	 transcend the usual parameters of music to create worlds of their own. Wh
	en it’s clear that what you’re listening to isn’t just a collection of tha
	t year’s songs\, but a deeply thought-out\, architected space where ideas 
	clash\, converse\, interlock\; these are the albums that end up lasting we
	ll beyond their era\, changing with us\, and revealing new surprises every
	 time we return to them. One of the clearest examples of an album that cra
	fts a strange and beautiful world not quite like any other is Rocketship’s
	 1996 full-length debut A Certain Smile\, A Certain Sadness. Even upon arr
	ival\, this was an experience unto itself\, and 30 years later\, these eig
	ht songs of bittersweet bliss still feel new. Slumberland is delighted to 
	release a 30th Anniversary edition of this instant classic\, making it rea
	dily available on vinyl and CD once again after years of unavailability an
	d collector demand.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ b

	wisDeface the Currency TourSat April 18thDoors 8:3021+$22adv/$25doshttps:/
	/themessthetics.bandcamp.com/album/the-messthetics-and-james-brandon-lewis
	Deface the Currency\\\, the new second collaborative album from the Messth
	etics andJames Brandon Lewis\\\, grew out of a simple intuition. The group
	 with saxophonistLewis joining the core Messthetics lineup of Brendan Cant
	y on drums\\\, Joe Lally on bass and Anthony Pirog on guitar was on tour i
	n the summer of 2025 when Canty knew it was time to go back into the studi
	o. This configuration of the band had debuted on record the year prior\\\,
	 releasing an acclaimed self-titled album via Impulse!\\\, the legendary j
	azz label. But as the quartet logged serious time on the road\\\, the drum
	mer felt their chemistry evolving\\\, so he called up engineer Don Godwin 
	and booked a couple of days at Tonal Park in Takoma Park\\\, Maryland\\\, 
	where The Messthetics and James Brandon Lewis was recorded.Deface the Curr
	ency preserves the tightness and variety of its predecessor\\\, but across
	 the albums seven tracks\\\, it reveals new levels of confidence and risk.
	 On pieces such as the title track named after a quote from Greek philosop
	her Diogenes that speaks to challenging societal norms and a new version o
	f Serpent Tongue\\\, which first appeared on the Messthetics self-titled 2
	018 debut\\\, the quartet reaches ecstatic peaks that convey fun as much a
	s ferocity. More than any earlier statement by the band\\\, the record sea
	mlessly melds the sounds that make up its collective DNA\\\, from punk roc
	k to free jazz and funk\\\, balancing compositional precision with palpabl
	e improvisational fire.\n\nFrom Clock-Out Lounge

	, they made a new album. More on that later. In the meantime\, 2026 marks 
	the 10-year anniversary of their acclaimed third record\, Full Of It\, rel

	and will play their first headlining shows since 2022\, performing the alb
	um front to back in Portland at Mississippi Studios and Seattle at Sunset 
	Tavern with longtime friends and Portland legends Divers.\n\nFull Of It\, 
	the album Pitchfork praised for “expertly balancing flame-belching Mad Max
	 riffage with lyrics frankly exploring questions of codependence and need\
	,” captured a turning point for the band\, sharpening their raw\, hook-dri
	ven sound into something more focused and intense. The anniversary is bein
	g marked with a vinyl repress\, two Northwest shows\, and a new album arri
	ving later this year.\n\nIs this a victory lap? No\, not really. It’s a re
	set\, a return and whatever happens when you decide you aren’t actually fi
	nished.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ bar and venue
	 and does not accept vertical ID’s for entry.\n\nFrom Sunset Tavern

DESCRIPTION:Emily Nenni and Movin Shoes is all about the right fit. Made in
	 Memphis\, the Nashville based singer-songwriters fourth full length album
	 is as much about dancing as following the steps of understanding and resp
	ect. Nennis songs reflect her solicitude\, but are much more soulful in th
	is setting - taking inspiration from the many impassioned performers of th
	e region\, to 60s girl groups and honky tonk heroes.Pairing once again wit
	h producer John James Tourville (The Deslondes)\, Movin Shoes was cut at M
	att -Ross-Spangs new Southern Grooves studio. The 13 tracks tie up nicely 
	with added covers from Paul Simon\, Delbert McClinton and Cass Elliott. Mo
	vin Shoes will be released on May 1st via New West Records.\nThis event is
	 21 and over. Any ticket holder unable to present valid identification ind
	icating that they are at least 21 years of age will not be admitted to thi
	s event\, and will not be eligible for a refund. This ticket is for admiss

	formance and nothing else. Other goods and services may be purchased once 
	inside the venue. Please note\, seating is limited and is available on a f

DESCRIPTION:maye and Ambar Lucid come together for a joint tour that celebr

	tage.Born in Venezuela and based in the US\, maye has built a devoted glob
	al following through deeply personal songwriting that blends Latin roots\,
	 indie pop\, and alternative soul. Her music feels diaristic yet expansive
	\, anchored by vulnerability\, warmth\, and a voice that invites listeners
	 inward rather than pushing outward.Ambar Lucid\, a Mexican-Dominican arti
	st raised between cultures\, brings a hypnotic\, cinematic presence that f
	uses psychedelic pop\, dreamlike visuals\, and bilingual storytelling. Her
	 work explores identity\, intuition\, and self-discovery\, pairing etherea
	l production with striking lyricism that resonates across borders.Together
	\, maye and Ambar Lucid create a shared live experience that feels intimat
	e\, immersive\, and emotionally charged. This tour is not about spectacle 
	for spectacles sake\, but about connection. Two artists\, two worlds\, and
	 one space where language\, culture\, and feeling dissolve into something 
	singular and unforgettable.\nAll sales are final. There are no refunds unl

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $25 ($31.68 after fees)\n\nDay of: $30 ($36.83 after f

	Dave and Henry hail from the tiny farming community of Kojonup\, a town th
	ree hours south of Perth\, Western Australia.\n\nStarting out as school fr
	iends and rehearsing in a makeshift space in an old farm shed\, Old Mervs 
	are a far cry from their humble beginnings.\n\nRiding a wave of wins\, Old
	 Mervs are celebrating a massive 2025 after the success of their ARIA-char
	ting debut album release and sold out tours across Australia\, the United 
	States\, the UK and Europe.\n\nRecorded with ARIA award-winning producer C
	hris Collins\, their debut self-titled album scored coveted Australian you
	th broadcaster triple j’s Feature Album of the week and landed at #1 on th
	e ARIA album charts\, winning hearts with hits “Parched“\, “What You’ve Lo
	st”\, “Forget It”\, “Everyone Will See It” and “Don’t Go”.\n\nIn 2025\, th
	e pair embarked on a mammoth 20 date album tour across Australia and New Z
	ealand along with their biggest headline home-state show to date at Perth 
	HPC. They then headed to the US to play at world-renowned festival Lollapa
	looza alongside names like Olivia Rodrigo\, Tyler the Creator and Sabrina 
	Carpenter\, bookended by a massive run of headline shows across the States
	\, stopping in for a Audiotree session too. They closed out the year with 
	a return to the UK and their first ever shows in Europe.\n\nThis year look
	s to be just as big\, if not bigger. With new music in the pipeline\, and 
	a stack of touring at home and across the globe\, Old Mervs are thrilled t
	o return to the US again for a stack of huge headline shows\, along with K
	ilby Block Party\, Gov Ball and more dates to be announced!\n\nPlease note
	\, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ bar and venue and does not accept v

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $23.50 ($31.93 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($33.48 afte

	esn’t seem to fit in anywhere\, but have proven to fit in everywhere. Star
	ting out with just acoustic guitars and a wooden box\, the band created an
	 immediate buzz in their hometown of Dublin\, Ireland.\n\nSeemingly uncapa
	ble of keeping themselves boxed in to one singular genre\, they meander in
	tentionally around heavy metal\, Irish folk music\, stadium rock\, and pos
	t punk. Constantly evolving both creatively and sonically\, never resting 
	on their laurels\, never taking themselves too seriously\, while always pu
	tting their souls into the music. They have won the hearts of anyone that 
	has experienced their live shows\, and have garnered a cultlike following 
	in their native Ireland\, the UK and most recently mainland Europe and Nor
	th America.\n\nFrom Sunset Tavern

DTSTAMP:20260222T201907Z
DTSTART:20260619T030000Z
DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($26.27 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($31.42 after f
	ees)\n\nAlela Diane:\n\nMore than a decade into one of contemporary folk’s
	 most quietly extraordinary careers\, Alela Diane returns on May 22 with W
	ho's Keeping Time? via Fluff & Gravy / Loose Music.\n\nThe Portland songwr
	iter’s seventh full-length album came as the consequence of intuition\, co
	incidence\, and community. On the first of April last year\, Michael Hurle
	y\, folk legend and indispensable presence in the Portland music scene\, d
	ied at the age of eighty-three. “I was absolutely gutted\,” says Alela\, w
	ho didn’t just revere Hurley but knew him well. She performed in a tribute
	 show for Hurley\, and in that collective mourning\, found solace and insp
	iration. “It was an epiphany to realize how much I missed my community. I 
	felt very clear about what I wanted in that moment—I want to be alive. I w
	ant to see live music. I want to play it.”\n\nThough she’d taken the solo 
	route on her last handful of releases\, Alela was interested in a new way 
	forward. Plucking the day away in the attic of her 1892 Victorian home\, s
	he found new songs flickering in the dusty light—and a desire to play them
	 with people.\n\nAlela met drummer Danny Austin-Manning at Clay Street Stu
	dios one night and he introduced her to co-producer Sam Weber (Madison Cun
	ningham\, Anna Tivel). Along with Sebastian Owens on bass\, they recorded 
	fifteen songs in less than five days—all live in the very attic where she 
	wrote them. Anna Tivel contributed backing vocals and violin. Peter Lalish
	\, of the band Lucius\, added guitar. Fellow Pacific Northwesterners Kati 
	Claborn and Luke Ydstie of Blind Pilot and AC Sapphire provided overdubs o
	f all kinds. Alela’s vision for uninhibited music and revived\, creative k
	inship thrust her into a new season.\n\nThe result is an 11-track set rang
	ing from lulling to raw to cinematic\, with Alela’s mellifluous voice a li
	vely and affecting instrument throughout. The lyrics reveal an artist with
	 the particular kind of strength required to face pain without getting los
	t—an ability Alela has honed over a lifetime of songwriting\, during which
	 her lustrous discography has garnered major critical acclaim from the lik
	es of Pitchfork\, NPR Music\, The Guardian\, and plenty more. UNCUT has ch
	aracterized her skill as “insanely beautiful\, with the strength and delic
	acy of spider silk” while counting her work among the ‘50 best singer-song
	writer albums’ of all time—a canon comprising John Lennon\, Joni Mitchell\
	, Joan Baez\, and Paul Simon. Consequence has echoed that significance\, d
	eclaring\, “Hers is a timeless sound\, that of a wayfaring troubadour\, wh
	ich only seems to come a few times a generation.”\n\nWith Who’s Keeping Ti
	me?\, Alela Diane transforms grief into gathering\, reaffirming her place 
	as a vital\, living force in contemporary folk music—rooted in community\,
	 presence\, and the enduring power of song.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Ta
	vern is a strictly 21+ bar and venue and does not accept vertical ID’s for
	 entry.\n\nFrom Sunset Tavern

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($26.27 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($31.42 after f
	ees)\n\nMariel Buckley:\n\nUnapologetically genuine\, wry and soft-hearted
	\, Mariel Buckley has planted her flag firmly as a songwriter who’s in it 
	for the long haul. She aims to find herself squarely on the fringes and ex
	actly where she belongs: singing and writing songs for the underdogs. Rais
	ed in the heart of Canada’s rodeo and country music scenes\, she was desti
	ned to challenge the boundaries around her\, both in life and in song. Wit
	h a fearless spirit that’s consistently broken through both genre and pers
	onal barriers\, Buckley’s unique blend of angst-driven alt-folk has made h
	er a standout artist\, offering a fresh and dynamic perspective on modern 
	Americana music.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ bar 
	and venue and does not accept vertical ID’s for entry.\n\nFrom Sunset Tave
