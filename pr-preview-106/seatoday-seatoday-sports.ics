	 Charismatic leaders. These are the dictators\, demagogues and false idols
	 who\, around the world at this very moment\, are stoking division and ign
	iting war in the name of nothing but self-gain. They’re also the unmistaka
	ble target of Wheel’s latest album of the same name: a seven-song prog met
	al opus that strives for all things right in a world gone wrong. Since for
	ming in 2015\, Wheel have swiftly grown from underdogs of Helsinki\, Finla
	nd\, to an international tour de force. The angular riffs\, unforgettable 
	melodies and adventurous scope of the trio’s 2019 debut\, Moving Backwards
	\, was instantly adored by fans of megastars from Tool to Coheed & Cambria
	. Then\, 2021 follow up Resident Human received rave reviews from publicat
	ions across the planet\, praising its sonic evolution and bravely dystopia
	n themes. Charismatic Leaders was meticulously crafted to meet Wheel’s eve
	r-heightening benchmarks. Its songs date as far back as 2020\,and recordin
	g with engineers/co-producers Daniel Bergstrand and Fredrik Thordendal \\(
	Meshuggah\\) stretched from August to December 2023. The end result\, mixe
	d by Forrester Savell\, has consolidated all the gains of what came before
	: singer/guitarist James Lascelles\, lead guitarist Jussi Turunen\, bassis
	t Jere Lehto and drummer Santeri Saksala’s third album represents their he
	aviest and most conscious music to date. Already\, Wheel have toured the w
	orld with such prog metal idols as Epica\, Leprous\, Vola and Soen\, and i
	t’s easy to imagine the irresistible hook of “Disciple” or the explosive g
	uitars of “Submission” only amplifying the excitement of their shows. Whee
	l’s The Dark Side Tour 2026 will take fans deep into the band’s musical un
	iverse\, showcasing songs rarely heard on stage next to classics from thei
	r catalogue. Wheel will revive hidden gems\, creating an intense and immer
	sive live experience. This tour promises a unique journey for longtime fol
	lowers and a thrilling discovery for newcomers alike Accessibility Disclai
