DTSTAMP:20260224T071133Z
DTSTART:20250515T010000Z
DESCRIPTION:Join your friends and coworkers here for a raucous\, good time 
	WED 5/14. 6-11pm. If you were here last year...well\, you know you had fun
	. Our 60 taps (and clean lines) are focused on Seattle &amp\; WA-based bre
	weries and cider makers\; typically you can expect 42 local kegs on tap an
	d others waiting on deck (chances are draft from your favorite Seattle bre
	weries). Free live music 7-9pm\, good food and the annual\, double elimina
	tion\, SBW Corn Hole Tournament that starts off friendly enough ~ then ten
	ds to get serious. How it works is a Rep/Owner/Brewer from each brewery on
	 hand is paired with a non-beer-biz person. Swag prizes abound. We have a 
	lot of space and lots of boards\, so typically everybody gets to play. But
	 if you 100% want to play\, show up closer to 5pm (and/or email Kelly@theG
	rowlerGuys.com).So\, come throw some bags\, drink some great Seattle-based
	 beer\, chum up with industry friends you may already know\, and just hang
	 out for a few hours with other craft-loving guests. It's an Open Party. F
	eel free to invite coworkers &amp\; friends. Great beer\, food\, corn hole
	\, live music\, parking ~ I feel an Underberg coming on...\n\nFrom Seattle

	 it might be more beneficial to plan these networking events around our Mi
	nority Veterans Training Program. So please feel free to come for the coff
	ee and networking and stay for a training on "Understanding and Honoring t
	he Black Military Experience. Which will begin at 1130. Coffee\, soft drin
	ks\, and snacks will be provided. What to expect: - Informal\, come-as-you
	-are networking - Connection with fellow Veteran service providers If you'
	re interested in attending\, hosting in the future\, or learning more\, I'
	d love to connect. Please feel free to share this invitation with colleagu
	es who may also benefit. Parking can be a little tight at the community ce
	nter at times. If the lot directly in front of the building is full\, ther
	e is an overflow lot just behind it. When you enter the building\, we are 
	located on the second floor all the way down past the elevators. The build
	ing is ADA accessible through the side entrance. I hope to see you there. 
	Please invite your colleagues.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Food & Drink

DESCRIPTION:Training with Faculty\, Staff\, and Community: Can the Universi
	ty be a “House of Peace”?\n\nWednesday\, March 4\, 9am-12pm\, with breakfa
	st at 8:30am\n\nOberto Commons\, Sinegal 200\n\n \n\nPope Leo has called o
	n every community across the globe to become a “house of peace.” This work
	shop will use nonviolent tools and exercises to explore what this metaphor
	 could mean in practical terms to Seattle University. Is it already a “hou
	se of peace”? How might it become more of a “house of peace”?\n\n \n\nKen 
	Butigan is a changemaker who has organized campaigns and movements resisti
	ng war\, challenging nuclear weapons\, and standing with the unhoused. He 
	was a founder of the Pledge of Resistance\, which mobilized nonviolent dir
	ect action for a decade to end US military intervention in Central America
	. He works with Pace e Bene’s Campaign Nonviolence that mobilizes thousand
	s of actions in the U.S. and around the world every year challenging war\,
	 poverty\, racism\, and environmental destruction. He is a senior advisor 
	to Pax Christi International’s Catholic Institute for Nonviolence based in
	 Rome. He taught for many years in the Peace\, Justice\, and Conflict Stud
	ies Program at DePaul University in Chicago. He hails originally from Seat
	tle.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Food & Drink

SUMMARY:Tyler McGinnis @ Perihelion Brewery 
DTSTAMP:20260224T071133Z
DTSTART:20260318T020000Z
DESCRIPTION:Born and raised in Los Angeles\, CA It was not until after grad
	uating high school and moving to Fremont\, NE\, to attend Midland Universi
	ty on scholarship for football that Tyler began to pursue his passion for 
	music with vigor. After graduating\, he relocated to Seattle\, WA in the s
	ummer of 2017\, where he currently resides and has been making impressive 
	leaps and bounds in his songwriting\, performing\, and overall musical ide
	ntity during his time in the PNW. His creative spin on past and present ex
	periences breeds songs that lyrically offer a sensationalized window into 
	his life. Tyler boasts powerful vocal performances that mix rich styles of
	 Americana and Alternative Country music with Southern Rock and a fresh tw
	ist of soulful melodies. His music will have you singing along to a good t
	ime drinking song\, reminiscing about long lost love and the regretful or 
	questionable choices of your past\, then leave you feeling uplifted\, refr
	eshed\, and in an all around good mood.\n\nFrom Perihelion Brewery
