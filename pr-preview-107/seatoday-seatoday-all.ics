SUMMARY:TADAIMA: I'm Home
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260224T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260224T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home

	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M

	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

DTSTART:20260225T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light invites you to become par
	t of the art. Agha\, a Pakistani American artist\, animates spaces with he
	r large-scale sculptural installations. Suspended from the ceiling\, Agha’
	s steel cubes are laser-cut with intricate designs that project geometric 
	shadows onto the visitor. She draws on both the light and dark of her own 
	life\, using South Asian art practices to convey the gender discrimination
	 she faced growing up as a young girl in Pakistan. An in-depth exploration
	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh
	ibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history. Agha is c
	arving a name out for herself in the art world—visit the Seattle Asian Art
	 Museum for an immersive and illuminating experience.

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260225T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260225T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.

DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260226T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260226T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260226T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260226T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

DTSTART:20260227T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260227T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260227T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien

	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

	ng self-defense and chasing big dreams\, Bruce’s journey reminds us that f
	inding your way means first figuring out who you are. Come see how Seattle
	 shaped him into a flexible\, fluid\, and flowing master—and how he reshap
	ed the world.

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home

	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch

	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys

	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien

	 Charismatic leaders. These are the dictators\, demagogues and false idols
	 who\, around the world at this very moment\, are stoking division and ign
	iting war in the name of nothing but self-gain. They’re also the unmistaka
	ble target of Wheel’s latest album of the same name: a seven-song prog met
	al opus that strives for all things right in a world gone wrong. Since for
	ming in 2015\, Wheel have swiftly grown from underdogs of Helsinki\, Finla
	nd\, to an international tour de force. The angular riffs\, unforgettable 
	melodies and adventurous scope of the trio’s 2019 debut\, Moving Backwards
	\, was instantly adored by fans of megastars from Tool to Coheed & Cambria
	. Then\, 2021 follow up Resident Human received rave reviews from publicat
	ions across the planet\, praising its sonic evolution and bravely dystopia
	n themes. Charismatic Leaders was meticulously crafted to meet Wheel’s eve
	r-heightening benchmarks. Its songs date as far back as 2020\,and recordin
	g with engineers/co-producers Daniel Bergstrand and Fredrik Thordendal \\(
	Meshuggah\\) stretched from August to December 2023. The end result\, mixe
	d by Forrester Savell\, has consolidated all the gains of what came before
	: singer/guitarist James Lascelles\, lead guitarist Jussi Turunen\, bassis
	t Jere Lehto and drummer Santeri Saksala’s third album represents their he
	aviest and most conscious music to date. Already\, Wheel have toured the w
	orld with such prog metal idols as Epica\, Leprous\, Vola and Soen\, and i
	t’s easy to imagine the irresistible hook of “Disciple” or the explosive g
	uitars of “Submission” only amplifying the excitement of their shows. Whee
	l’s The Dark Side Tour 2026 will take fans deep into the band’s musical un
	iverse\, showcasing songs rarely heard on stage next to classics from thei
	r catalogue. Wheel will revive hidden gems\, creating an intense and immer
	sive live experience. This tour promises a unique journey for longtime fol
	lowers and a thrilling discovery for newcomers alike Accessibility Disclai

	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080047Z
DTSTART:20260303T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.

	n every community across the globe to become a “house of peace.” This work

DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260304T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260304T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh
	ibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history. Agha is c
	arving a name out for herself in the art world—visit the Seattle Asian Art
	 Museum for an immersive and illuminating experience.

DTSTART:20260304T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260304T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.

	 print studio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have co
	mpleted the introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on the
	ir own projects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderato
	r\, who can provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in ou
	r Screen Printing 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at 
	Open Sessions: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press
	 for shirts\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just scree
	n preparation. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are lookin
	g for is sold out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be noti
	fied when a ticket becomes available. For Open Sessions\, Vera provides: -
	 Rentable screens - Emulsion and emulsion remover - Squegees - Basic tools
	 like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc. Participants must provide their own:
	 - Substrate \\(paper\, t-shirts\, etc\\) - Water based ink Vera \\*does n
	ot\\* allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio 
	is not set up to safely process non-water based ink. If you have any quest
	ions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org. \\*\\*FAQ\\*\\* 1. Can Vera p
	rint a transparent stencil for me? Yes — You must send us your stencil at 
	least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF\
	, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edit
	s to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when
	 you arrive. If you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Ver
	a\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print ser
	vice location. 2. What if I need direct assistance on my projects? Our mod
	erators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the SP 101 class 
	offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advice on your p
	roject\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. If you have 
	a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please reach out to m
	att@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring. 3. I really want to us
	e your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no slots available? O
	ur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our Open Session is sold 
	out — We have limited space in the studio and several events every day at 
	Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time for Open Sessions. 
	If you're interested in booking the studio outside of Open Sessions\, plea
	se email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private rental rates and avail
	ability.

DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home

	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260305T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o

	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260306T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home

	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

DESCRIPTION:Before he was a legend\, Bruce Lee was just a young man trying 
	to figure it all out—right here in Seattle. This action-packed\, soul-sear
	ching story follows the Young Dragon as he navigates a new country and fin
	ds his voice. Through movement\, magic\, and heart\, we meet the human beh
	ind the icon—flawed\, fierce\, and full of possibility. Watch as Lee learn
	s to clear his brain by mimicking the white noise of water and begins fusi
	ng martial arts with philosophy. From street fights in Hong Kong to teachi
	ng self-defense and chasing big dreams\, Bruce’s journey reminds us that f
	inding your way means first figuring out who you are. Come see how Seattle
	 shaped him into a flexible\, fluid\, and flowing master—and how he reshap
	ed the world.

DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260308T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.

DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this

	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.

SUMMARY:TADAIMA: I'm Home
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260309T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.

SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080048Z
DTSTART:20260309T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.
