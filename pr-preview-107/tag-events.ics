SUMMARY:Susan Meiselas: Crossings
DTSTAMP:20260224T080142Z
DTSTART:20260224T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

DTSTART:20260224T200000Z
DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light
DTSTAMP:20260224T080143Z
DTSTART:20260225T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light invites you to become par
	t of the art. Agha\, a Pakistani American artist\, animates spaces with he
	r large-scale sculptural installations. Suspended from the ceiling\, Agha’
	s steel cubes are laser-cut with intricate designs that project geometric 
	shadows onto the visitor. She draws on both the light and dark of her own 
	life\, using South Asian art practices to convey the gender discrimination
	 she faced growing up as a young girl in Pakistan. An in-depth exploration
	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh
	ibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history. Agha is c
	arving a name out for herself in the art world—visit the Seattle Asian Art
	 Museum for an immersive and illuminating experience.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - C

DTSTART:20260225T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Event

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080143Z
DTSTART:20260225T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community

DTSTAMP:20260224T080143Z
DTSTART:20260226T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

DTSTART:20260226T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080143Z
DTSTART:20260226T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community & Civic

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080143Z
DTSTART:20260226T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Event

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080143Z
DTSTART:20260226T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cu

DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives

	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know

	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

DTSTART:20260228T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080144Z
DTSTART:20260228T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DTSTAMP:20260224T080144Z
DTSTART:20260228T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080144Z
DTSTART:20260301T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080144Z
DTSTART:20260301T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080144Z
DTSTART:20260301T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community & Civic

	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g

DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260303T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this

	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera

	on workshop hosted by Society \\+ Technology at UW and the Center for an I
	nformed Public designed to help you translate your research into compellin
	g public commentary. Academic research is deeply relevant to pressing issu
	es of our times\, but it can be challenging to know how to reach audiences
	 beyond the academy.\n\nThis work shop helps you build practical skills fo
	r bringing your expertise to a wider audience by focusing on the ins and o
	uts of op-ed writing. We'll kick off with a brief panel discussion from me
	mbers of the UW commu nity who have written op-eds\, then we'll discuss ho
	w you can do the same -- from identifying a timely hook\, crafting a persu
	asive short piece\, and navigating the submissions process. Come prepared 
	to hear from colleagues\, use resources\, and participate in interactive e
	xercise s. The ambitious may leave with a draft op-ed and a concrete plan 
	for submitting it. Everyone will gain a clearer understanding about how to
	 write for new audiences.\n\nREGISTER:\n\ntinyurl.com…\n\nCo-hosts and fac

	n every community across the globe to become a “house of peace.” This work
	shop will use nonviolent tools and exercises to explore what this metaphor
	 could mean in practical terms to Seattle University. Is it already a “hou

DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o

	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the

DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Event

DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this 
	exhibition by Susan Meiselas intertwines documentary photographs of Centra
	l America during the 1970s and 1980s \\(from Nicaragua and El Salvador\\) 
	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light invites you to become par
	t of the art. Agha\, a Pakistani American artist\, animates spaces with he
	r large-scale sculptural installations. Suspended from the ceiling\, Agha’
	s steel cubes are laser-cut with intricate designs that project geometric 
	shadows onto the visitor. She draws on both the light and dark of her own 
	life\, using South Asian art practices to convey the gender discrimination
	 she faced growing up as a young girl in Pakistan. An in-depth exploration
	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh
	ibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history. Agha is c
	arving a name out for herself in the art world—visit the Seattle Asian Art
	 Museum for an immersive and illuminating experience.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - C

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260305T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community & Civic

DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives

	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community & Civic

SUMMARY:Boren Banner Series: Camille Trautman
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260306T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Event

DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Events

SUMMARY:TADAIMA: I'm Home
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

SUMMARY:Samantha Yun Wall: What We Leave Behind
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Cul

SUMMARY:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Anila Quayyum Agha: Geometry of Light invites you to become par
	t of the art. Agha\, a Pakistani American artist\, animates spaces with he
	r large-scale sculptural installations. Suspended from the ceiling\, Agha’
	s steel cubes are laser-cut with intricate designs that project geometric 
	shadows onto the visitor. She draws on both the light and dark of her own 
	life\, using South Asian art practices to convey the gender discrimination
	 she faced growing up as a young girl in Pakistan. An in-depth exploration
	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh
	ibition of a Pakistani American artist in SAM’s 90-year history. Agha is c
	arving a name out for herself in the art world—visit the Seattle Asian Art
	 Museum for an immersive and illuminating experience.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - A

SUMMARY:TADAIMA: I'm Home
DTSTAMP:20260224T080145Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:After more than 80 years\, a treasured collection returns “home
	” to Seattle’s Japanese American community. In 1942 dozens of traditional 
	Boys’ and Girls’ Day dolls were entrusted to Bailey Gatzert Elementary Sch
	ool by Japanese American families facing forced incarceration. Most were n
	ever reclaimed after the war. Artist Miya Sukune uses recent research in M
	OHAI’s collection\, as well as interviews with Japanese American survivors
	 and their descendants\, to create an installation called “Tadaima\,” mean
	ing “I’m home.”\n\nTADAIMA: “I’m Home!” Bringing Seattle’s Girls’ and Boys
	’ Day Dolls Home reconnects the dolls with their traditional role of prote
	cting and blessing children. It invites visitors to celebrate the resilien
	ce\, memory\, and enduring traditions of the Japanese American Community.\

DTSTAMP:20260224T080146Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Samantha Yun Wall’s new paintings use overlapping silhouettes o
	f female figures as portals to unknown spaces and different temporal realm
	s. Impetus for the new body of work is a Korean folk tale in which the Pas
	que flower is symbolic of a grandmother who passed away without the loving
	 care of her grandchildren. It is a story of melancholy\, loss\, and remem
	brance. The delicate hair on the flower’s stem differentiates it\, and the
	 artist gives the plant a surreal aspect in some of her paintings\, replac
	ing the flower’s center with a watchful eye.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community

	 of Islamic architecture\, art\, and identity\, this is the first solo exh

SUMMARY:Kameelah Janan Rasheed: we leak\, we exceed
DTSTAMP:20260224T080146Z
DTSTART:20260307T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Kameelah Janan Rasheed \\(b. 1985\, East Palo Alto\, CA\; lives
	 and works in Brooklyn\, NY\\) is a self-described “learner” who creates m
	ulti-media works that explore the poetics-pleasures-politics of Black know
	ledge production\, information technologies\, \\[un\\]learning\, and belie
	f formation. She often integrates found images and words alongside her own
	 writing to create collaged wall installations and experimental video work
	s. Across her work\, Rasheed investigates the revision and life cycles of 
	text\, embracing expanded and embodied forms of writing and reading.\n\nwe
	 leak\, we exceed will activate the unique volume and multiple vantage poi
	nts of the Henry’s double-height gallery\, drawing together threads from p
	hysics\, Black critical thought\, and information theory to create an imme
	rsive environment that interrogates the spatial and social implications of
	 compression. A common process used in data storage\, spatial organization
	\, and information systems\, compression abbreviates and collapses complex
	 ideas into more simplified forms. Rasheed questions the way compression c
	omes at the cost of nuance and creates unrecoverable losses. She draws par
	allels between the compression of information and the containment of peopl
	e\, both physically and through the structuring and defining of identities
	. Through a network of video\, sound\, and architectural mark-making\, Ras
	heed proposes alternatively what she calls “an embrace of Black excess and
	 expansion” as a liberatory practice.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community & Civic

	ng self-defense and chasing big dreams\, Bruce’s journey reminds us that f
	inding your way means first figuring out who you are. Come see how Seattle

DTSTAMP:20260224T080146Z
DTSTART:20260308T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Every photograph is a reminder that the act of framing is never
	 neutral. In Camille Trautman’s first solo museum exhibition in their home
	town\, the Seattle-born Duwamish artist uses photography and video to chal
	lenge colonial narratives and counter Indigenous erasure. The exhibition p
	resents selections from their ongoing series The North American LCD—spectr
	al self-portraits staged in varied natural landscapes. Rooted in Trautman’
	s process of coming out as transgender\, the images show the artist’s body
	 partially obscured by large LCD screens. The series examines how both lan
	dscape photography and digital media can shape or distort cultural identit
	y\, often by promoting or denying visibility.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - All Event

SUMMARY:Young Dragon: A Bruce Lee Story
DTSTAMP:20260224T080146Z
DTSTART:20260308T180000Z
DESCRIPTION:Before he was a legend\, Bruce Lee was just a young man trying 
	to figure it all out—right here in Seattle. This action-packed\, soul-sear
	ching story follows the Young Dragon as he navigates a new country and fin
	ds his voice. Through movement\, magic\, and heart\, we meet the human beh
	ind the icon—flawed\, fierce\, and full of possibility. Watch as Lee learn
	s to clear his brain by mimicking the white noise of water and begins fusi
	ng martial arts with philosophy. From street fights in Hong Kong to teachi
	ng self-defense and chasing big dreams\, Bruce’s journey reminds us that f
	inding your way means first figuring out who you are. Come see how Seattle
	 shaped him into a flexible\, fluid\, and flowing master—and how he reshap
	ed the world.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Arts & Culture

DESCRIPTION:First presented at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1990\, this

	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit

	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera

	along with panoramic images from the US/Mexico border taken in 1989. Addit
	ional photographs of the US/Mexico border taken in 2018 are also featured 
	in a site-specific gallery installation. The exhibition invites viewers to
	 see immigration in the context of economic and political crises in the re
	gion.\n\nToday\, the work feels newly urgent. US immigration enforcement h
	as expanded through militarization and constant surveillance\, with leader
	s using fear-driven language to divide communities and legitimize brutal f
	orms of control.\n\nThese photographs ask us to look carefully\, to recogn
	ize familiar patterns\, and to hold on to our shared humanity across the g
	lobe. People move in search of safety\, possibility\, and a better life fo
	r their families\, which is a universal hope that crosses borders\, genera
	tions\, and time.\n\nFrom SEAtoday - Community & Civic
