SUMMARY:Is Your Team O-1 Ready?
DESCRIPTION:​For founders\, early engineers\, and small startups working with international talent\, the H-1B lottery can add an extra layer of planning to hiring decisions\, especially as rules and processes continue to evolve. \n​The O-1A visa can be a strong alternative in some cases\, but it comes with its own set of considerations. Success depends on understanding how USCIS defines “extraordinary ability\,” what credible evidence looks like in practice\, and how to present a body of work that shows sustained impact\, not just titles or credentials. \n​This workshop breaks down the O-1A visa in depth: what it requires\, where eligibility is most often misunderstood\, and how to build cases that actually work. Rather than treating the O-1 as a checklist to complete\, we’ll work through live cases discussing how USCIS weighs evidence\, evaluates narrative\, and makes decisions. \n​What We’ll Cover: \n​What “extraordinary ability” actually means: How USCIS evaluates impact and achievement in practice\, not in theory \n​Meeting criteria vs. presenting a strong case: Why checkboxes aren’t enough and what makes a petition compelling \n​Common red flags and misconceptions: Where O-1 cases typically stumble and how to avoid those pitfalls \n​Strategic considerations for startups: When the O-1 makes sense for founding teams\, early hires\, and retention \n​How Casium approaches O-1 cases: Building strong petitions from the start with clarity and realism \n​Live case reviews: We’ll work through real scenarios and profile assessments together \n​Who Should Attend: This workshop speaks to multiple audiences: \n​Founding engineers and technical leaders assessing whether an O-1 is realistic for them now or in the future \n​Founders and startup leaders evaluating the O-1 as a strategic alternative to H-1B lottery dependency for key team members \n​Aspiring founders exploring immigration pathways before launching their companies \n​This is a working session\, not a lecture. We’ll walk through the framework\, work through live examples together\, and leave substantial time for Q&A and workshopping specific situations. Bring your questions\, edge cases\, and actual profiles you’re evaluating and navigating.

SUMMARY:AI Transformation in the Global Energy Business - AMA with Sunjay Pandey (BP)
DESCRIPTION:​As Chief Product and Technology Officer (CPTO) at BP\, Sunjay Pandey leads product\, engineering\, data\, and AI across the $66B global energy giant. \n​In our virtual AMA\, we’ll talk about: \n​• What translated from Amazon to BP\, and what broke the moment he entered an asset-heavy industry\n• How to lead teams solving everything from internal enterprise software to consumer payments and ads\, to deeply technical systems tied to fields and infrastructure\n• How to prioritize across radically different risk profiles\, time horizons\, and user bases\n• When to build\, when to buy\, and whether startups can earn trust when software becomes core infrastructure\n• How the bar for AI rises when failure impacts safety and performance\, not just engagement\n• Which AI capabilities will actually matter for energy and utilities\, and which are still overhyped \n​We will also ask the human questions. What has he learned about leadership at scale? How he manages his own energy? What shifts when you move between big tech and global enterprise? What advice he would give to builders in the room?

SUMMARY:Empire of AI: How to Reclaim Democracy and Build a Fairer Future
DESCRIPTION:AI is upending the planet in real time\, and its path of unchecked development threatens to erode democracy and return us to an age of empire\, where a small group of companies dictates our future. It doesn’t have to be this way\, says Karen Hao\, a Silicon Valley engineer-turned-award-winning-journalist. She is the featured speaker at this Center for Business Ethics event on March 5\, 2026\, 5:00 to 6:30 p.m.. \nHao’s epic and urgent book Empire of AI—an instant New York Times bestseller called a “heroic work” by Shoshana Zuboff (The Age of Surveillance Capitalism)—is the culmination of her years of insider access to OpenAI and her original reporting\, spanning five continents. In captivating keynotes\, packed with hard-won insights\, she assembles the fullest picture yet of the most consequential tech arms race in history. She shows us just how thoroughly AI will alter society\, and\, more importantly\, what role we can all play in actively shaping AI so that it benefits everyone. “The way we develop technology is now fundamentally broken\,” Hao says. “But I truly believe that we can fix it.”

SUMMARY:Discovery Series\, Dr. Bruce Maxwell\, Teaching Professor & Director of Computing Programs\, Northeastern University Seattle
DESCRIPTION:What if the way we prepare images for computers is getting in the way of understanding them?\nMost digital images are designed to look good to human eyes. But what’s best for people isn’t always best for machines. Bruce Maxwell\, teaching professor at Northeastern University’s Seattle campus\, explores how rethinking image formats—especially how brightness and color are represented—can unlock new capabilities in computer vision. \n​Inspired by how the human eye processes light\, Maxwell’s research shows that using alternative formats can make AI models more stable under changing lighting\, reveal hidden patterns\, and improve performance across tasks like object recognition and image generation. His experiments suggest that small changes in how we feed images to machines can lead to big improvements in how they interpret the world. \n​This talk invites us to look beneath the surface of everyday images—and discover how seeing differently might help machines see better. \n​About the Discovery Series: designed to bring together the state’s preeminent researchers\, innovative leaders\, and elected officials who want to stay on top of important advancements being made in our state\, each Discovery Series program includes lunch\, networking time\, a Q&A session\, and an opportunity to meet the speaker.

SUMMARY:Discovery Series\, Dr. Cyrus Ghjar\, Professor\, Fred Hutch
DESCRIPTION:What if cancer didn’t strike in one dramatic moment—but instead lingered\, quietly\, for years? Long after a tumor seems gone\, cancer cells can lie dormant. And sometimes\, they return. This is the mystery of metastatic relapse—and the frontier where Dr. Cyrus Ghajar works. \n​At Fred Hutch Cancer Center\, Ghajar leads research into how dormant cancer cells evade treatment and what reactivates them. His lab bridges oncology\, immunology\, and bioengineering to explore the role of the immune system in suppressing dormant cancer cells. It’s a delicate numbers game that can tip the balance between remission and recurrence. \n​Supported by the National Institutes of Health\, the Kuni Foundation\, U.S. Department of Defense and other funders\, Ghajar holds the Peter S. Lefkarites Memorial Endowed Chair. Ghajar’s work is reshaping how we think about metastasis—not as a sudden invasion\, but a slow\, stealthy process that might be intercepted. Join us to explore how silence in the body might hold the key to preventing relapse.

SUMMARY:7th Annual World ALLoT Congress
DESCRIPTION:Continuing from the outstanding success of IEEE AIIoT 2025\, we are very proud to present IEEE World AI IoT Congress 2026 which will provide an opportunity for researchers\, educators and students to discuss and exchange ideas on issues\, trends and developments in the related fields of AI and IoT. The conference aims to bring together scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds to emphasize the dissemination of ongoing research in the fields of AI and IoT. Research papers are invited describing original work in the above-mentioned fields and related technologies. The conference will include a peer-reviewed program of technical sessions. This year we will be hosting the conference physically. \nThis conference will also promote an intense dialogue between academia and industry to bridge the gap between academic research\, industry initiatives\, and governmental policies. This is fostered through panel discussions\, keynotes\, and industry exhibits where academia is exposed to state-of-practice and results from trials and interoperability experiments. The industry in turn benefits by exposure to leading-edge research in networking as well as the opportunity to communicate with academic researchers regarding practical problems that require further research.
