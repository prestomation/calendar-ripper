SUMMARY:The Lowest Pair- Album Release Show w/ The Hackles
DTSTAMP:20260225T070516Z
DTSTART:20260309T023000Z
DESCRIPTION:The Lowest Pair has questions. The duo\, made up of Kendl Winte
	r and Palmer T. Lee\, know that we tend to see duality as a problem. We wa
	nt life to be linear\, working through the dark to finally get to the ligh
	t. Grief to joy\, despair to hope\, confusion to claritynot a jangly cycle
	 we cant escape. But through their incandescent folk songs\, the Lowest Pa
	ir often ask: What if we sit with the mess? What if thats not just more pe
	aceful\, but more magical\, too? On their 8th album Always As Young As Wel
	l Ever Be\, the Lowest Pair prove that over the last dozen years together\
	, theyve become some of modern roots musics most mesmerizing\, thoughtful 
	purveyors. Produced by Tucker Martine (The Decemberists)\, the 10-track al
	bum puts the duos stark lyricism\, string-driven arrangements\, and raw co
	mpatibility on brilliant display and as a result\, Always As Young As Well
	 Ever Be pulses with life. The Lowest Pairs musicianship is another beauti
	ful testament not just to playing that breathes\, but playing that listens
	. Winter\, who grew up in Arkansas but has lived in Washington State for t
	he last two decades\, and Lee\, a Minnesota native\, first gained attentio
	n as poetic singer-songwriters on banjos. While their family of strings ha
	s expanded\, their fundamental approach hasnt: Respond to sounds and stori
	es the other is making.\nThis event is 21 and over. Any ticket holder unab

DTSTAMP:20260225T070516Z
DTSTART:20260415T030000Z
DESCRIPTION:Ten years ago before earning gold records\, Logan toured in his
	 89 station wagon named Glenn and developed a devoted following of fans ac
	ross the country that loved his unique and relatable experience of crowd-s
	ourced touring. This spring as an homage to how Logan toured in his statio
	n wagon\, weve rebooted the Glenn tour for one last ride. Over his nearly 
	two-decade career\, Logan has risen as a top independent artist\, bending 
	the country genre with his unique heartland rock sound and racking up over
	 500 million streams. Hes shared the stage with legendary acts including E
	ric Church\, Jamey Johnson\, Sawyer Brown\, Wade Bowen and many more. Loga
	ns singles Better Off Gone and Grew Apart have both earned RIAA Gold certi
	fication. Logans next full-length record Cottonwood Falls will be released
	 this spring.\nThis event is 21 and over. Any ticket holder unable to pres
