DESCRIPTION:By Neil Simon\n\nThey’ve just said\, “I do\,” but can their lov
	e handle five flights of stairs and a tiny New York apartment? A buttoned-
	up young lawyer and his free-spirited bride stumble into married life\, ec
	centric neighbors\, leaky ceilings\, and romantic chaos. Full of wit\, che
	mistry\, and charm\, this classic rom-com bubbles over with laughter and w
	armth. Love is messy—and that's what makes it fun.\n\nFrom Taproot Theatre
