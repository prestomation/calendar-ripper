SUMMARY:Commemorating the Takeover of Fort Lawton
DESCRIPTION:The history of Discovery Park is inseparable from the bold activism of the Native community. In March 1970\, the Takeover of Fort Lawton sparked a movement that changed the landscape of Seattle forever.  \n  \n\n\n\n\nWhen Fort Lawton was declared surplus land\, Native activists invoked 1855 treaty rights to reclaim land for the community. While many remember the iconic March 8th fence scaling\, we gather this year to honor the second occupation where leaders of the movement heroically scaled the cliffs at Fort Lawton. This strategic move ultimately helped UIATF secure a permanent space for the Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center.  \n  \n\n\n\n\nToday\, we steward 20 acres at Daybreak Star\, but our connection to the 500-acre vision remains. Join us for a commemorative march starting where the second occupation took place and ending at Daybreak Star for guest speakers and lunch! \n\n\n\n March 7th\, 2026\n 11:30 AM – 2:00 PM\n Lunch will be served after the march at 1:00 PM at Daybreak Star\n\n Shuttles provided after lunch to North & South parking lots (see map) \n\n\n\n#DiscoveryPark #daybreakstarindianculturalcenter #SeattleHistory #NativeActivism #FortLawton #IndigenousRights #AmericanIndianMovement
