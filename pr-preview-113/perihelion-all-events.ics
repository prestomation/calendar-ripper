SUMMARY:Tyler McGinnis @ Perihelion Brewery 
DTSTAMP:20260226T193352Z
DTSTART:20260318T020000Z
DESCRIPTION:Born and raised in Los Angeles\, CA It was not until after grad
	uating high school and moving to Fremont\, NE\, to attend Midland Universi
	ty on scholarship for football that Tyler began to pursue his passion for 
	music with vigor. After graduating\, he relocated to Seattle\, WA in the s
	ummer of 2017\, where he currently resides and has been making impressive 
	leaps and bounds in his songwriting\, performing\, and overall musical ide
	ntity during his time in the PNW. His creative spin on past and present ex
	periences breeds songs that lyrically offer a sensationalized window into 
	his life. Tyler boasts powerful vocal performances that mix rich styles of
	 Americana and Alternative Country music with Southern Rock and a fresh tw
	ist of soulful melodies. His music will have you singing along to a good t
	ime drinking song\, reminiscing about long lost love and the regretful or 
	questionable choices of your past\, then leave you feeling uplifted\, refr
	eshed\, and in an all around good mood.\n\nhttps://www.perihelion.beer/eve
