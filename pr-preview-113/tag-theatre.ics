	mance\\\, setting the performers in a new format with special guest improv
	isers showcasing their signature style or a never-before-seen format. Your
	 suggestions fuel the fire\\\, and the improvisers will ignite the stage\\
	\, bringing your ideas to life. \\nPart Two: The second half launches from
	 a single audience suggestion\\\, setting the performers in motion. It mig
	ht start with a song\\\, a monologue\\\, or a rapid-fire group connection 
	game. Whatever emerges will inspire spontaneous stories\\\, surprising twi
	sts\\\, and big comedic swings. \\nLoose Cannons is fueled by audience ide
	as\\\, fearless performers\\\, and the thrill of not knowing what happens 
	next. You light the fuse. They run with it. What they create is entirely u
	p to you.\n\nFrom Unexpected Productions\n\nhttps://www.unexpectedproducti

DESCRIPTION:By Neil Simon\n\nThey’ve just said\, “I do\,” but can their lov
	e handle five flights of stairs and a tiny New York apartment? A buttoned-
	up young lawyer and his free-spirited bride stumble into married life\, ec
	centric neighbors\, leaky ceilings\, and romantic chaos. Full of wit\, che
	mistry\, and charm\, this classic rom-com bubbles over with laughter and w
	armth. Love is messy—and that's what makes it fun.\n\nFrom Taproot Theatre
