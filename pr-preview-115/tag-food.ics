SUMMARY:Wine Tasting Featuring Andrew Will Winery
DTSTAMP:20260228T054555Z
DTSTART:20260313T000000Z
DESCRIPTION:An Evening of Elegance: Andrew Will Winery Tasting\n\nExperienc
	e the pinnacle of Washington winemaking on Thursday\, March 12\, from 5:00
	 PM to 7:00 PM\, as we host the legendary Andrew Will Winery. \n\nFounded 
	in 1989 by Chris Camarda and now led by his son\, winemaker Will Camarda\,
	 Andrew Will is a pioneer in the “Old World” style of Washington State win
	es. Eschewing the trend of over-oaked\, flamboyant reds\, Andrew Will focu
	ses on structured\, age-worthy\, and site-specific blends that allow the t
	erroir of the state’s most prestigious vineyards—Champoux\, Ciel du Cheval
	\, and Two Blondes—to shine through. \n\nThis is a rare opportunity to tas
	te through a curated selection of their current releases\, which often pul
	l some of the highest critical scores in the country. From their silky\, m
	ineral-driven Bordeaux blends to their supple Merlots\, these are “intelle
	ctual” wines designed for both the cellar and the table. \n\nEvent Highlig
	hts: \n\nThe Wines: A guided tasting of world-class vineyard-designate ble
	nds.\n\nThe Story: Learn about the Vashon Island-based winery’s 35\\+ year
	 commitment to artisanal craft and vineyard primacy.\n\nThe Vibe: A sophis
	ticated yet approachable evening for wine enthusiasts and collectors alike
	.\n\nWhether you are a long-time fan of Chris Camarda’s legendary Sorella 
	or looking to discover why Andrew Will is consistently ranked among the to
	p 100 wineries in the world\, this is a tasting you won’t want to miss.\n\
