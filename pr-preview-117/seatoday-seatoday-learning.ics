	on workshop hosted by Society \\+ Technology at UW and the Center for an I
	nformed Public designed to help you translate your research into compellin

	es of our times\, but it can be challenging to know how to reach audiences
	 beyond the academy.\n\nThis work shop helps you build practical skills fo
	r bringing your expertise to a wider audience by focusing on the ins and o
	uts of op-ed writing. We'll kick off with a brief panel discussion from me
	mbers of the UW commu nity who have written op-eds\, then we'll discuss ho
	w you can do the same -- from identifying a timely hook\, crafting a persu
	asive short piece\, and navigating the submissions process. Come prepared 
	to hear from colleagues\, use resources\, and participate in interactive e
	xercise s. The ambitious may leave with a draft op-ed and a concrete plan 
	for submitting it. Everyone will gain a clearer understanding about how to
	 write for new audiences.\n\nREGISTER:\n\ntinyurl.com…\n\nCo-hosts and fac

SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260301T053027Z
DTSTART:20260313T210000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\\\\\\*\\*\\* Vera’s screen
	 print studio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have co
	mpleted the introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on the
	ir own projects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderato
	r\, who can provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in ou
	r Screen Printing 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at 
	Open Sessions: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press
	 for shirts\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just scree
	n preparation. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are lookin
	g for is sold out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be noti
	fied when a ticket becomes available. For Open Sessions\, Vera provides: -
	 Rentable screens - Emulsion and emulsion remover - Squegees - Basic tools
	 like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc. Participants must provide their own:
	 - Substrate \\(paper\, t-shirts\, etc\\) - Water based ink Vera \\*does n
	ot\\* allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio 
	is not set up to safely process non-water based ink. If you have any quest
	ions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org. \\*\\*FAQ\\*\\* 1. Can Vera p
	rint a transparent stencil for me? Yes — You must send us your stencil at 
	least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF\
	, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edit
	s to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when
	 you arrive. If you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Ver
	a\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print ser
	vice location. 2. What if I need direct assistance on my projects? Our mod
	erators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the SP 101 class 
	offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advice on your p
	roject\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. If you have 
	a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please reach out to m
	att@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring. 3. I really want to us
	e your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no slots available? O
	ur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our Open Session is sold 
	out — We have limited space in the studio and several events every day at 
	Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time for Open Sessions. 
	If you're interested in booking the studio outside of Open Sessions\, plea
	se email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private rental rates and avail
	ability.\n\nhttps://seatoday.6amcity.com/events/#/details/screen-printing-
