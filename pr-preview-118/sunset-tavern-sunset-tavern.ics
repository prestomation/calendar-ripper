DESCRIPTION:Advance: $15 ($20.09 after fees)\n\nDay of: $18 ($26.27 after f
	ees)\n\nILUKA:\n\nAustralian singer-songwriter ILUKA returns to her homela
	nd from Los Angeles on her first global tour in support of her new album\,
	 the wild\, the innocent\, & the raging. A fierce celebration of individua
	lity\, womanhood\, and defiance\, the album embraces ILUKA’s unapologetic 
	honesty — a quality that has defined her as one of alt-pop’s most vital di
	sruptors. ILUKA isn’t afraid to be outspoken\, share her feelings\, let ou
	t a little rage\, or get weird. This unabashed honesty underscores her art
	istry as she stretches the boundaries of pop with blunt lyrics sweetened b
	y disarmingly catchy songcraft and a bewitching aesthetic.\n\nPlease note\
	, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ bar and venue and does not accept ve
	rtical ID’s for entry.\n\nhttps://link.dice.fm/M53eb37615b1

	d does not accept vertical ID’s for entry.\n\nLiz Cooper:\n\nThe thing abo
	ut finding yourself is there's always another corner to turn. The Vermont-
	based singer/songwriter Liz Cooper made her third album during a period of
	 intense self-discovery and reinvention. She moved to New York for the fir
	st time\, weathered a pandemic\, came out to herself after falling in love
	 with a friend\, and experienced her first queer relationship and breakup\
	, all in the course of a few years. New Day marks both a personal and a mu
	sical revolution for Cooper – a plunge into psychedelic pop depths and a f
	ullhearted reflection of a whirlwind chapter in her life. These songs scin
	tillate with the kind of self-confidence that only beams through after you
	've aimed a sharp gaze inward and realized that whatever you see will alwa
	ys keep darting ahead of you.\n\nhttps://link.dice.fm/h78f204a871c

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($28.33 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($33.48 after f
	ees)\n\nThe Thing:\n\nWhat is The Thing? It’s a New York band\, sure\, but
	 it’s also an ethos. A return to rock & roll’s roots — to garage bands toi
	ling between the family minivans\, to groups like the Beatles and their un
	ique alchemy\, to tape machines and live band recordings instead of slick 
	studios and myriad songwriters. “We've kind of adapted the ethos of: with 
	restriction comes creativity — old becomes new. And throughout every part 
	of the process that remains true\,” says guitarist/vocalist Jack Bradley.\
	n\nNever is that more apparent than on their self-titled third record\, ou
	t August 6th on their own label. A rough and tumble suite of 12 songs that
	 nods to everyone from The Kinks to The White Stripes\, The Thing sounds l
	ike old New York revivicated and remixed. “It showcases all of us\, all of
	 our different personalities\,” says bassist/vocalist Zane Acord. “In The 
	Thing\, we’re a collective band. We hang our hats on being a true band — w
	here we all have the spotlight. I think that gives us a different edge.” T
	hat album follows 2023’s debut\, Here’s the Thing\, and The Things Is\, wh
	ich dropped the following year.\n\nThe four members of Thing came from int
	ersecting backgrounds\, lending to their rock-and-roll-as-melting-pot vibe
	. Acord grew up with a drummer dad who hipped him to bands like Led Zeppel
	in and Grand Funk Railroad\; he met guitarist/vocals Michael Carter — an a
	vid Beatles fan — in middle school. The duo went on to collect Bradley in 
	high school\, an aspiring producer with a studio in his basement and a yen
	 for psych rock. Jazz drummer Lucas Ebeling linked up with the band when e
	veryone found their way to New York in 2022. They’ve since played more tha
	n 300 shows across the world.\n\nThe band’s self-titled work\, then\, is a
	 culmination of all those influences — and all that hustle. “We threw all 
	of our different various influences throughout — all the decades of rock a
	nd roll and adjacent genres — and ended up with something of our own\,” Br
	adley says. “Our contribution to the genre. Our style. Our… thing.”\n\nhtt

DESCRIPTION:Moved from Madame Lou's\n\nAdvance: $29.50 ($38.11 after fees)\
	n\nDay of: $32 ($40.69 after fees)\n\nWesterman:\n\nWesterman is a London-
	born\, Athens-based artist and songwriter signed to Partisan Records. Know
	n for his thoughtful lyrics and genre-fluid sound\, he has earned critical
	 acclaim across two full-length albums and multiple EPs\, with support fro
	m Pitchfork\, Rolling Stone\, The Guardian\, Stereogum\, NPR Music + more.
	\n\nAfter building early momentum with a series of singles and the Ark EP 
	(2018)\, Westerman released his debut album Your Hero Is Not Dead in 2020.
	 Produced with long-time collaborator Bullion (Nathan Jenkins)\, the album
	 was recorded between Southern Portugal and London and received widespread
	 critical praise. Pitchfork described the album as “excellent\,” highlight
	ing its fusion of soft rock\, ambient textures\, and lyrical introspection
	. Key tracks included “Blue Comanche\,” “Think I’ll Stay\,” and the title 
	track\, all of which received strong playlisting and airplay support acros
	s DSPs and BBC Radio.\n\nIn 2023\, Westerman returned with his sophomore L
	P An Inbuilt Fault\, co-produced with Big Thief’s James Krivchenia. The al
	bum marked a sonic departure\, incorporating more live instrumentation\, p
	olyrhythmic structures\, and raw vocal delivery. It was developed\n\ndurin
	g sessions in Los Angeles with a circle of experimental musicians and mixe
	d by Krivchenia\, expanding Westerman’s palette into more emotionally dyna
	mic territory. The lead single “CSI: Petralona” was praised by Office Maga
	zine and Stereogum\, and accompanied by international touring\, including 
	sold out headline shows in NYC\, LA\, Chicago\, and London.\n\nAcross his 
	career\, Westerman has been featured in The New York Times\, The FADER\, a
	nd Clash\, and has performed at key festivals including End of the Road an
	d Primavera. His visual collaborations with renowned graphic designer Bráu
	lio Amado have been widely recognized\, forming a consistent visual identi
	ty across releases.\n\nWesterman will release another new album in 2025\, 
	more details on that to come!\n\nhttps://link.dice.fm/B7c99e91b260

	in 2009 and put out his first official release "Jarvage Vol.1" in 2016. He
	 has since released four full-length projects in his modern yet classic bo

	\, Mr. Lif & Akrobatik\, Sadat X\, Spose\, The Palmer Squares and so on.\n
	\nRDGLDGRN:\n\nRDGLDGRN have always been about the blending of worlds. Eve
	n their name stems from the merging of its member’s diverse influences and
	 personalities\, each represented by a corresponding color - Red (Guitar)\
	, Gold (Bass) and Green (Vocals). On LP3\, they’ve managedto set a new bar
	 for how contrasting sounds can come together. With that being said\, it’s
	 no surprise that it is also the record they’ve had the most control over.
	 After learning the many lessons of navigating the major label system over
	 the past six years\, the band will be releasing LP3 on their own label\, 
	Deuce Day World. It is an album that the band feels finally captures the i
	dea RDGLDGRN was based. “Everyone views us in a different way\,” Green add
	s\, “and in the past that has defined our music. On LP3\, the music captur
	es exactly how we see ourselves”.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a

	r perfect blend of country and western\, yet impossible to know what to ca
	ll it or do with it. Jonny calls it Dad Country\; a theme park tailor made
	 for dad’s. That’s his genre (so he says) and if that makes sense to you t
	hen you ought to have your head checked. The guy does it all. He is a fame
	d leatherworker known for covering household items in hand- tooled leather
	 (from microwaves and coffee grinders to telecasters). He’s made guitar st
	raps for all your favorite bands and he even co-wrote the hit song All You
	r Favorite Bands (with Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes). Currently residing in t
	he foothills of Los Angeles\, he hasn’t toured much in the past few years 
	since focusing on selling houses and raising his daughter. He’s branded hi
	mself as L.A.’s Only RealtorTM and has become quite successful at selling 
	multi-million dollar properties to the stars. Not to mention he’s the Musi
	c Director of a boutique music venue in Sonoma County\, CA called Little S
	aint that has garnered some major headlines for their surprise shows featu
	ring the likes of boygenius\, Phoebe Bridgers\, Rufus Wainwright\, Hiss Go
	lden Messenger\, Lavender Country and so many more. There’s a special frea
	kiness Fritz brings to whatever he does. Selling real estate\, running mar
	athons\, songwriting\, or leather-working. It somehow all makes sense once

SUMMARY:Sam Blasucci\, guests
DTSTAMP:20260301T055352Z
DTSTART:20260508T030000Z
DESCRIPTION:$15 ($20.09 after fees)\n\nSam Blasucci:\n\nPhysical Dream is S
	am Blasucci’s fourth studio album and first double LP. It’s a sensorial\, 
	immersive record that shimmers\, shudders\, and grooves with genre-blurrin
	g mastery. The 28-track album unfolds like a living body—nonlinear and dyn
	amic\, alive with cascading instrumentals\, buoyant boogie rhythms\, and a
	 sound that is simultaneously groovy and poetic.\n\nRecorded over just two
	 weeks on a remote island property in Sooke\, British Columbia\, Physical 
	Dream was born close to the ground. Blasucci slept in a small shack on the
	 land while working closely with engineer and collaborator Jonny Payne. Ad
	ditional recording took place in studios across Los Angeles and Ojai\, Cal
	ifornia. The album includes contributions from Mia Wilson (vocals)\, Randa
	l Fisher (horns\, flute)\, Andres Renteria (percussion)\, Laena Myers (vio
	lin\, viola\, vocals)\, and Leng Bian (harp).\n\nAside from traditional in
	strumentation\, the album also gives voice to the environments where the m
	usic was made. Night sounds recorded on Blasucci’s Ojai property appear on
	 “WHO LIVES ON THESE LANDS.” Running water from a Big Sur waterfall appear
	s on “ORCHIDS.” “SI SE PUEDE” includes audio recorded at an anti-ICE prote
	st in Oxnard\, California. These elements expand the album’s sense of spac
	e and relationship. Blasucci’s voice is deeply personal and human\, yet co
	nstantly in dialogue with a wider living world—and asking it to dance.\n\n
	Lyrically\, Physical Dream holds romance\, mysticism\, and political resis
	tance side by side. Musically\, the album feels like Leonard Cohen\, Princ
	e\, and Brian Eno gave birth to a bilingual\, fantastical\, hypnotic phant
	om dance baby. Animated by introspection and motion\, Physical Dream invit
	es listeners into reflection and movement in equal measure.\n\nBorn in Nor
	theast Los Angeles\, Blasucci has lived across the U.S. and Mexico\, inclu
	ding Coahuila\, New Orleans\, and Orem\, and now finds home in Ojai\, Cali
	fornia. He learned music from his father as a child and formed Mapache at 
	age 20\, releasing 5 albums before launching his solo career in 2023.\n\nP
	hysical Dream will be released this spring on vinyl and all streaming plat
	forms.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Tavern is a strictly 21+ bar and venue

DESCRIPTION:Advance: $20 ($26.27 after fees)\n\nDay of: $25 ($31.42 after f
	ees)\n\nAlela Diane:\n\nMore than a decade into one of contemporary folk’s
	 most quietly extraordinary careers\, Alela Diane returns on May 22 with W
	ho's Keeping Time? via Fluff & Gravy / Loose Music.\n\nThe Portland songwr
	iter’s seventh full-length album came as the consequence of intuition\, co
	incidence\, and community. On the first of April last year\, Michael Hurle
	y\, folk legend and indispensable presence in the Portland music scene\, d
	ied at the age of eighty-three. “I was absolutely gutted\,” says Alela\, w
	ho didn’t just revere Hurley but knew him well. She performed in a tribute
	 show for Hurley\, and in that collective mourning\, found solace and insp
	iration. “It was an epiphany to realize how much I missed my community. I 
	felt very clear about what I wanted in that moment—I want to be alive. I w
	ant to see live music. I want to play it.”\n\nThough she’d taken the solo 
	route on her last handful of releases\, Alela was interested in a new way 
	forward. Plucking the day away in the attic of her 1892 Victorian home\, s
	he found new songs flickering in the dusty light—and a desire to play them
	 with people.\n\nAlela met drummer Danny Austin-Manning at Clay Street Stu
	dios one night and he introduced her to co-producer Sam Weber (Madison Cun
	ningham\, Anna Tivel). Along with Sebastian Owens on bass\, they recorded 
	fifteen songs in less than five days—all live in the very attic where she 
	wrote them. Anna Tivel contributed backing vocals and violin. Peter Lalish
	\, of the band Lucius\, added guitar. Fellow Pacific Northwesterners Kati 
	Claborn and Luke Ydstie of Blind Pilot and AC Sapphire provided overdubs o
	f all kinds. Alela’s vision for uninhibited music and revived\, creative k
	inship thrust her into a new season.\n\nThe result is an 11-track set rang
	ing from lulling to raw to cinematic\, with Alela’s mellifluous voice a li
	vely and affecting instrument throughout. The lyrics reveal an artist with
	 the particular kind of strength required to face pain without getting los
	t—an ability Alela has honed over a lifetime of songwriting\, during which
	 her lustrous discography has garnered major critical acclaim from the lik
	es of Pitchfork\, NPR Music\, The Guardian\, and plenty more. UNCUT has ch
	aracterized her skill as “insanely beautiful\, with the strength and delic
	acy of spider silk” while counting her work among the ‘50 best singer-song
	writer albums’ of all time—a canon comprising John Lennon\, Joni Mitchell\
	, Joan Baez\, and Paul Simon. Consequence has echoed that significance\, d
	eclaring\, “Hers is a timeless sound\, that of a wayfaring troubadour\, wh
	ich only seems to come a few times a generation.”\n\nWith Who’s Keeping Ti
	me?\, Alela Diane transforms grief into gathering\, reaffirming her place 
	as a vital\, living force in contemporary folk music—rooted in community\,
	 presence\, and the enduring power of song.\n\nPlease note\, the Sunset Ta
