SUMMARY:The Lowest Pair- Album Release Show w/ The Hackles
DTSTAMP:20260301T055352Z
DTSTART:20260309T023000Z
DESCRIPTION:The Lowest Pair has questions. The duo\, made up of Kendl Winte
	r and Palmer T. Lee\, know that we tend to see duality as a problem. We wa
	nt life to be linear\, working through the dark to finally get to the ligh
	t. Grief to joy\, despair to hope\, confusion to claritynot a jangly cycle
	 we cant escape. But through their incandescent folk songs\, the Lowest Pa
	ir often ask: What if we sit with the mess? What if thats not just more pe
	aceful\, but more magical\, too? On their 8th album Always As Young As Wel
	l Ever Be\, the Lowest Pair prove that over the last dozen years together\
	, theyve become some of modern roots musics most mesmerizing\, thoughtful 
	purveyors. Produced by Tucker Martine (The Decemberists)\, the 10-track al
	bum puts the duos stark lyricism\, string-driven arrangements\, and raw co
	mpatibility on brilliant display and as a result\, Always As Young As Well
	 Ever Be pulses with life. The Lowest Pairs musicianship is another beauti
	ful testament not just to playing that breathes\, but playing that listens
	. Winter\, who grew up in Arkansas but has lived in Washington State for t
	he last two decades\, and Lee\, a Minnesota native\, first gained attentio
	n as poetic singer-songwriters on banjos. While their family of strings ha
	s expanded\, their fundamental approach hasnt: Respond to sounds and stori
	es the other is making.\nThis event is 21 and over. Any ticket holder unab
	le to present valid identification indicating that they are at least 21 ye
	ars of age will not be admitted to this event\, and will not be eligible f

DTSTART:20260415T030000Z
DESCRIPTION:Ten years ago before earning gold records\, Logan toured in his
	 89 station wagon named Glenn and developed a devoted following of fans ac
	ross the country that loved his unique and relatable experience of crowd-s
	ourced touring. This spring as an homage to how Logan toured in his statio
	n wagon\, weve rebooted the Glenn tour for one last ride. Over his nearly 
	two-decade career\, Logan has risen as a top independent artist\, bending 
	the country genre with his unique heartland rock sound and racking up over
	 500 million streams. Hes shared the stage with legendary acts including E
	ric Church\, Jamey Johnson\, Sawyer Brown\, Wade Bowen and many more. Loga
	ns singles Better Off Gone and Grew Apart have both earned RIAA Gold certi
	fication. Logans next full-length record Cottonwood Falls will be released
	 this spring.\nThis event is 21 and over. Any ticket holder unable to pres
