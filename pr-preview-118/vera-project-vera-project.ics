SUMMARY:Screen Printing Open Session
DTSTAMP:20260301T055352Z
DTSTART:20260328T190000Z
DESCRIPTION:You MUST take the SP 101: Intro to Vera's Screen Print Studio c
	lass before you can sign up for an Open Session\n\nVera’s screen print stu
	dio offers four-hour Open Sessions where individuals who have completed th
	e introductory class may use our screen print lab to work on their own pro
	jects. Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator\, who ca
	n provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen P
	rinting 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessi
	ons: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media\, T-shirt Press for shirt
	s\, tote bags and other fabrics\, and Screen prep for just screen preparat
	ion. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is s
	old out\, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when 
	a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions\, Vera provides:\n\n- Ren
	table screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools 
	like spatulas\, rulers\, tape\, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their ow
	n:\n\n- Substrate (paper\, t-shirts\, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera does
	 not allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio\, as our studio i
	s not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any que
	stions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\nFAQ\n\n1\\. Can Vera pri
	nt a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at
	 least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF
	\, no larger than 12" x 18"\, and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edi
	ts to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit whe
	n you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at
	 Vera\, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print
	 service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects
	?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the S
	P 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advi
	ce on your project\, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. 
	If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance\, please re
	ach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I 
	really want to use your studio during an Open Session\, but there are no s
	lots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand\, so we apologize if our O
	pen Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several 
	events every day at Vera\, so it can be difficult for us to find more time
	 for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of 
	Open Sessions\, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private re
	ntal rates and availability.\n\nhttps://link.dice.fm/tc3f545ead15
