SUMMARY:Daybreak Star Forest Garden Land Tending: Tending Our Future
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Daybreak Star. \nThese gatherings are a place to return to the land\, to reconnect with Indigenous teachings\, and to be in community with each other in ways that are rooted\, relational\, and real. They’re about Indigenous food sovereignty\, cultural memory\, and reclaiming the right to care for land in the ways our ancestors always have. \nLed by community members and organizers with United Indians of All Tribes Foundation\, this work centers Indigenous knowledge systems and relationships with land that have existed here since time immemorial—and that continue\, despite every attempt to erase them. \nThe Forest Garden is growing with care—planted with camas\, salmonberry\, huckleberry\, wild strawberry\, nettle\, cedar\, and other Native plants that are more than food and medicine—they’re our teachers\, our elders\, and our ancestors. \nThese plants are being tended not just for harvest\, but to support the many Indigenous-centered programs at UIATF: elder meals\, youth programming\, cultural wellness\, and more. This is one way we practice sovereignty—by feeding ourselves\, our people\, and our spirits in alignment with our values. \nIn a time when many of us are searching for where to belong and how to show up—this is a space to meet one another\, build real relationships\, and map the power we already hold together. \nLet’s gather not just to work the land—but to connect\, share our stories\, and remember that we are each other’s safety\, each other’s strength\, and each other’s solution. \nRegister

SUMMARY:Root in Recipriocity: Tend Together
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Seward Park. \nCaring for the land that cares for us. \nThe land around us has been scarred by pollution\, carved over by development\, and fragmented by development expansion. To live in reciprocity means to give back\, to tend\, and to restore what has been lost. Are you in good relations with the land? By stepping into this work\, we have the chance to give back\, repair habitats\, support native wildlife\, and strengthen our connection to the Land. Restoration is our way of returning care to the land that has long sustained us. \nJoin us at Seward Park Audubon Center for Root in Reciprocity: Tend Together. Together\, we’ll be engaging in either the removal and repurpose of introduced species\, plant native flora\, and restore habitats that sustain birds\, pollinators\, and the broader ecosystem. All tools\, guidance\, and materials are provided\, just bring your curiosity\, care\, and willingness to get your hands in the soil. \nRegister

SUMMARY:Seattle: Mt. Baker Park
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Mount Baker Park. \nJoin EarthCorps and Green Seattle Partnership as we work to create a healthier forest in Mt Baker Park! Mt. Baker Park is located along a green boulevard that heads down to a bathing beach on Lake Washington. Situated in a residential neighborhood\, this park has become a community gathering place where people enjoy the many amenities of this park as well as its urban forest. The forest of Mt. Baker Park is being threatened by plant species such as ivy and blackberry. These plants take over parts of the forest by overgrowing and choking native vegetation. Join us as we work to get these species under control and keep the native plants thriving! \nRegister to meet.

SUMMARY:Daybreak Star Forest Garden Land Tending: Tending Our Future
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Daybreak Star. \nThese gatherings are a place to return to the land\, to reconnect with Indigenous teachings\, and to be in community with each other in ways that are rooted\, relational\, and real. They’re about Indigenous food sovereignty\, cultural memory\, and reclaiming the right to care for land in the ways our ancestors always have. \nLed by community members and organizers with United Indians of All Tribes Foundation\, this work centers Indigenous knowledge systems and relationships with land that have existed here since time immemorial—and that continue\, despite every attempt to erase them. \nThe Forest Garden is growing with care—planted with camas\, salmonberry\, huckleberry\, wild strawberry\, nettle\, cedar\, and other Native plants that are more than food and medicine—they’re our teachers\, our elders\, and our ancestors. \nThese plants are being tended not just for harvest\, but to support the many Indigenous-centered programs at UIATF: elder meals\, youth programming\, cultural wellness\, and more. This is one way we practice sovereignty—by feeding ourselves\, our people\, and our spirits in alignment with our values. \nIn a time when many of us are searching for where to belong and how to show up—this is a space to meet one another\, build real relationships\, and map the power we already hold together. \nLet’s gather not just to work the land—but to connect\, share our stories\, and remember that we are each other’s safety\, each other’s strength\, and each other’s solution. \nRegister
