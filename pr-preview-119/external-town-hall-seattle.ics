SUMMARY:Lauren Groff with Amber Flame
DESCRIPTION:Whether you know her from her short stories in The New Yorker or The Atlantic or from one of her bestselling novels\, Lauren Groff is arguably one of the leading literary voices in the U.S. Groff will share from her new collection of short stories\, Brawler\, which reflects upon humanity’s ceaseless battle between our dark and light angels. \nRanging from the 1950s to the present day and moving across age\, class\, and region––from New England to Florida to California––the nine stories in Groff’s newest collection dive into the animal and the divine within us all. \nThe characters paint a different picture of the same theme: a young woman suddenly responsible for her disabled sibling; a hot-tempered high school swimmer in need of an adult; a mother blinded by the loss of her family; and a banking successor with a different kind of inheritance. Motivated by love\, challenged by the double edges of other people’s good intentions\, they all try to do the right thing for as long as they can. It’s through these stories that Groff illuminates what it means to be human. \nGroff’s popularity comes from her insight into human nature. Through her various stories\, Brawler offers specific turning points in people’s lives\, highlighting all of our thin boundaries between love and fear\, compassion and violence\, reason and instinct\, altruism and what it takes to survive.

SUMMARY:Michael Pollan with Jon Mooallem
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to the phenomenon that is consciousness\, there is one point on which scientists\, philosophers\, and artists all agree: it feels like something to be us. Yet the fact that we have a subjective experience of the world remains one of nature’s greatest mysteries. How is it that our mental operations are accompanied by feelings\, thoughts\, and a sense of self? What would a scientific investigation of our inner life look like when we have as little distance and perspective on it as fish do of the sea? In A World Appears\, Michael Pollan traces the unmapped continent that is consciousness\, bringing radically different perspectives—scientific\, philosophical\, literary\, spiritual\, and psychedelic—to see what each can teach us about this central fact of life.

SUMMARY:Psychedelic Salon: Psychedelics & Substance Use
DESCRIPTION:Psychedelic therapy is rapidly gaining traction as a promising approach for addressing substance use disorders—from alcohol and opioids to nicotine and beyond. This session will explore how psychedelic compounds like ibogaine\, ketamine\, and psilocybin may help interrupt compulsive cycles\, uncover root causes of addiction\, and support sustained recovery. \nFeaturing Dr. Nathan Sackett of the UW Center for Novel Therapeutics in Addiction Psychiatry\, this conversation will examine how pairing psychedelic compounds with evidence-based behavioral interventions could transform the treatment of addiction. Drawing on his team’s cautious\, research-driven approach\, Dr. Sackett will discuss what’s known\, what remains to be discovered\, and how rigorous clinical study can help bring safe\, effective psychedelic-assisted therapies to those who need them most.

SUMMARY:St. Vincent (SOLD OUT)
DESCRIPTION:Annie Clark made her recorded debut as St. Vincent in 2007 with Marry Me\, quickly becoming regarded as one of the most innovative and fascinating presences in modern music. Her subsequent albums would include Actor (2009)\, Strange Mercy (2011)\, her self-titled fourth album\, and winner of the 2014 GRAMMY for Best Alternative Album. In 2017\, her fifth album MASS EDUCTION would break St. Vincent into the U.S. and UK top 10s and win two more GRAMMYs (Best Rock Song for its title track\, and Best Recording Package). 2021’s Daddy’s Home found St. Vincent channeling the hungover glamor and gritty sepia-toned soundtrack of 1970s downtown NYC to an ecstatic reception\, ultimately winning her a second Best Alternative Album GRAMMY.

SUMMARY:Evelyn Iritani with Frank Abe
DESCRIPTION:Across the water from Seattle\, you can visit the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial. It’s a place to honor and learn from the past. Evelyn Iritani\, a longtime Seattle resident and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist\, wants to remember – and learn from – another\, lesser-known story from World War II. In her book\, Safe Passage\, she reveals the dramatic\, behind-the-scenes efforts to bring U.S. and Japanese citizens home from enemy land. \nIn 1943\, during some of the Pacific theater’s bloodiest battles\, the United States and Japan coordinated the exchange of civilians caught on the wrong side of the battlefield after Pearl Harbor. Nearly fifteen hundred Allied civilians trapped in Asia\, mostly U.S. citizens\, sailed through dangerous waters to India\, where they were traded for Japanese immigrants sent from the U.S. The fate of the more than ten thousand U.S. civilians left behind in Asia rested on the success of this endeavor.

SUMMARY:Crowdsource Choir
DESCRIPTION:Crowdsource Choirs continues their Sing Seattle Songs theme—and once again\, you help shape the show by choosing the music. The songs may be born in Seattle\, inspired by Seattle\, or made iconic through Seattle films and stories—but the final setlist will emerge from your votes. \nChoose the songs you want to sing on by voting here. \nYour selections will directly influence what we learn\, layer\, and sing together in the room. \nTown Hall is the perfect home for this gathering—a civic space where the people of Seattle come together to express who we are\, where we come from\, and how our stories keep evolving. This night becomes a shared act of remembrance and re-creation\, sung by the city itself. \nNo rehearsals. No sheet music. No choir robes. Just a room full of voices\, Seattle pride\, and the soundtrack of the city we love—raised together in harmony. \nYou help choose the songs. We become the choir.

SUMMARY:American Echoes
DESCRIPTION:Solstice Symphony Orchestra returns on March 14 with a FREE Saturday evening concert. This performance also marks the debut of Solstice Camerata\, a new chamber-orchestra ensemble dedicated to repertoire written for smaller orchestral forces. \nAdmission is free; tickets are required. \nTitled American Echoes\, the concert will explore the “American sound” across time\, space\, and perspectives. The program opens with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Symphony No. 25\, which was composed the same year that the Boston Tea Party took place in the US (1773)\, situating its urgency and unrest within a wider moment of philosophical and political upheaval. The program then turns to four unique American voices from different eras and backgrounds — Charles Ives\, Florence Price\, Caroline Shaw\, and Aaron Copland — whose music engages with shared themes of doubt and devotion\, inheritance and reinvention\, intimacy and expansiveness. \nPerformed by a reduced ensemble in a chamber-orchestra setting\, American Echoes invites close listening and rewards reflection. Admission is free and open to all; tickets are required and will be available in advance. \nThis program is supported\, in part\, by a grant from the Washington State Arts Commission.

SUMMARY:Matthew Sutton with Bill Radke
DESCRIPTION:Whether or not you call yourself religious\, there’s no denying that religion has an impact on society across the continents. And there is no faith more dominant than Christianity in the United States today. Washington State University professor and historian Matthew A. Sutton can show you just exactly how evangelical Christianity entwines itself with all aspects of the country. Drawing from his book\, Chosen Land: How Christianity Made America and Americans Remade Christianity\, Sutton chronicles Christians’ five-hundred-year endeavor to turn the U.S. into their version of the kingdom of God.

SUMMARY:David Pogue
DESCRIPTION:Although the present ubiquity of Apple is well-known\, how much do you know about its past? Just in time for Apple’s 50th anniversary\, author and CBS correspondent David Pogue tells the history of the iconic company: how it was born\, nearly died\, and was revived under the legendary Steve Jobs\, and how it later became the most iconic brand in the world. \nOn April 1\, 1976\, two men in their 20s\, both named Steve\, founded a modest startup. Their goal was to bring the power of computers to everyone. Over the next five decades\, Apple revolutionized the tech landscape\, introducing the public to many products that we use today and marrying technology with design. \nMarking this 50th anniversary milestone is Apple: The First 50 Years\, a 600-page\, definitive account of the tech giant. \nAt this very special event\, author David Pogue will share what he learned from interviewing 150 current and former Apple executives\, designers\, and engineers. He’ll reveal\, for the first time\, some amazing origin stories (Apple II\, iMac\, iPod\, iPhone). He’ll draw some counterintuitive but powerful lessons from Apple’s unlikely rise\, fall\, and rise. And he’ll punctuate the evening with Apple song parodies at the piano (yes\, really).

SUMMARY:Cindy Cohn
DESCRIPTION:As we cascade further into the digital age\, concerns over privacy and data security continue to rise with increasing urgency. As artificial intelligence expands its reach\, vast aggregates of personal data are constantly being mined to refine future models. But\, the fight for digital privacy is as old as the digital age itself. In Privacy’s Defender: My Thirty-Year Fight Against Digital Surveillance\, author and Digital Rights Activist\, Cindy Cohn\, chronicles her career-long battle to preserve our right to privacy online. \nPart memoir and part legal history for a general audience\, Privacy’s Defender reminds the reader just how hard-won the privacy rights we enjoy today were. Cohn stresses the societal importance of digital privacy\, citing its role in combatting authoritarianism\, organizing public protests\, and reinforcing other human rights as well.

SUMMARY:Speaking of Seattle: Immigrant Rights Are Human Rights
DESCRIPTION:At a moment when national politics are testing the boundaries of constitutional protections and human dignity\, local communities are asking a vital question: What can we do to protect one another? \nJoin Town Hall Seattle and The Stranger for the March 19 edition of the Speaking of Seattle civic conversation series\, an evening focused on immigrant rights\, community responsibility\, and the everyday actions that help safeguard our neighbors. \nThis timely conversation will explore how federal immigration enforcement policies ripple through local communities — and how ordinary people can respond with care\, courage\, and solidarity. Together\, we’ll examine what it means to treat immigrant rights as human rights\, and how community members can act lawfully\, safely\, and effectively when confronted with fear-based tactics and unconstitutional overreach.

SUMMARY:Global Rhythms: Saha Gnawa
DESCRIPTION:Saha Gnawa brings North African futurism to the U.S.\, uniting the founders of Innov Gnawa with leading figures from New York City’s jazz and contemporary music scenes to reimagine modern Gnawa music. \nOften referred to as “Sufi Blues\,” Gnawa is rooted in Morocco’s ancient history. Over centuries\, infectious rhythms and polytheistic spiritual beliefs originating from West African slaves integrated with Islam and the indigenous culture of Morocco\, giving birth to a hybrid spiritual sect and musical community. The lyrics of Gnawa songs are prayers invoking saints and spirits for freedom and liberation. Gnawa music is revered and treasured throughout Morocco for its soulfulness and healing power. \nRefined via late-night sessions at LunÀtico in Bed-Stuy\, Brooklyn\, Saha Gnawa explores trance-like states through its intuitive interplay\, allowing ancestral rhythms and melodies to drift into unknown territories. What emerges is both an authentic performance of centuries-old Gnawa tradition and a bold step into new dimensions of sound — where traditional song forms dissolve into ecstatic dance tracks laced with subtle electronics. \nWatch: Saha Gnawa – Bacha Hamou / Baba Mimoun (Live at Brooklyn Bowl)

SUMMARY:Ibram X. Kendi
DESCRIPTION:Ibram X. Kendi\, the National Book Award-winning historian of Stamped from the Beginning charts how “great replacement theory” has moved from the margins to become the most dominant political theory of our time — and what we can do to safeguard democracy from this insidious threat. \nWhat is great replacement theory? Variations on the theory have existed for centuries\, but it was given this name by a French novelist in 2011 who believed Black and Brown immigrants were “invading” Europe\, brought by shadowy elites to “replace” Europe’s White population. From there\, politicians and theorists — whether in the United States or the United Kingdom\, Germany or Chile\, Hungary or Australia — repackaged the conspiracy as a story of “globalists” welcoming “migrant criminals” and diversity initiatives to take away the jobs\, cultures\, electoral power\, and the very lives of White people. Over time\, great replacement theory has expanded the threat to include citizens\, men\, Jews\, Christians\, heterosexuals\, and ethnic majorities in countries as distinct as Russia\, El Salvador\, Brazil\, Italy\, and India. All are targeted with the message that they are under an existential attack that only a strongman can prevent. \nRecall the words chanted in Charlottesville\, Virginia\, but heard around the world: “You will not replace us!” Recall the string of mass shooters around the world—in Oslo and Christchurch\, Buffalo\, El Paso\, and Pittsburgh—who claimed their crimes were a defense against “White genocide.” Recall business and media figures cultivating anxiety and furor over demographic change. These incidents only scratch the surface of this ascendant idea: Popular and ruling politicians in every region of the world have been expressing some version of great replacement theory\, eroding democratic norms in the name of preventing demographic change and restoring national greatness. \nIn our fast-shifting political landscape\, most people are unfamiliar with this theory’s origins and its spread\, which isn’t a coincidence. In Chain of Ideas\, international bestselling author Ibram X. Kendi uses exacting and clear prose to uncover the roots of great replacement theory and its various mutations around the world. It is an unsettling but indispensable global history of how great replacement theory brought humanity into this authoritarian age — and how we can free ourselves from it.

SUMMARY:Suzanne Simard with Lynda Mapes
DESCRIPTION:Forest ecologist Suzanne Simard has long been fascinated by the sharing of natural knowledge. From the interconnected root systems she studied in her book Finding the Mother Tree to her ongoing work as an educator\, Simard has learned to see the importance of cooperative efforts to share resources and knowledge. Joined in conversation by Seattle-based nature journalist Lynda Mapes\, Simard expands these connections into a considerate exploration of the elaborate cycles of forest ecosystems\, the challenges they currently face\, and the intergenerational value they can provide through her new book When the Forest Breathes: Renewal and Resilience in the Natural World. \nRaised in a family of loggers committed to sensible forest stewardship\, Simard has watched as modern practices and timber companies have left forests vulnerable to damage and depletion. In her research\, Simard explores the finely honed cycles of regeneration forests inherently use to maintain themselves. From mushrooms breaking down logs to dying elder trees passing their genetic knowledge to younger growth\, When the Forest Breathes presents these cycles as a key component in the protection and preservation of our forests. Working closely with Indigenous communities and the models of responsible forestry they’ve upheld over time\, Simard examines the damage caused by industrialization and wide-scale human intervention– particularly the impact on the overstory’s mother trees that are responsible for sharing intergenerational wisdom and supporting new growth.
