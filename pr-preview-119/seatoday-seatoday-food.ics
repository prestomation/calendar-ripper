	in 1989 by Chris Camarda and now led by his son\, winemaker Will Camarda\,

	erroir of the state’s most prestigious vineyards—Champoux\, Ciel du Cheval
	\, and Two Blondes—to shine through. \n\nThis is a rare opportunity to tas
	te through a curated selection of their current releases\, which often pul
	l some of the highest critical scores in the country. From their silky\, m
	ineral-driven Bordeaux blends to their supple Merlots\, these are “intelle
	ctual” wines designed for both the cellar and the table. \n\nEvent Highlig
	hts: \n\nThe Wines: A guided tasting of world-class vineyard-designate ble
	nds.\n\nThe Story: Learn about the Vashon Island-based winery’s 35\\+ year
	 commitment to artisanal craft and vineyard primacy.\n\nThe Vibe: A sophis
	ticated yet approachable evening for wine enthusiasts and collectors alike
	.\n\nWhether you are a long-time fan of Chris Camarda’s legendary Sorella 
	or looking to discover why Andrew Will is consistently ranked among the to
	p 100 wineries in the world\, this is a tasting you won’t want to miss.\n\
