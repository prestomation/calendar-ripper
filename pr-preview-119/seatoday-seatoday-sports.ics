SUMMARY:Lichen Walk
DTSTAMP:20260301T070141Z
DTSTART:20260313T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:Taught by Dr. Katherine Glew. Have you always wondered what lic
	hens are and why they are found on your trees\, rhododendrons and azaleas?
	 Lichens are harmless to your plants and add aesthetic value to your garde
	n. Learn about common lichens found in an urban environment and what they 
	tell us about air quality\, forest health\, geology and why they are indic
	ators of changes in the climate\, ecosystems\, and geology. You will leave
	 with a fresh understanding about lichens and a user-friendly chart that l
	ists lichens found in your neighborhood. This walk will be on trails with 
	various surfaces and may include gravel\, mulch\, or pavement. Please dres
	s for the weather and wear comfortable walking shoes. $28 BBGS members/$40
