	. Our 60 taps (and clean lines) are focused on Seattle &amp\; WA-based bre
	weries and cider makers\; typically you can expect 42 local kegs on tap an
	d others waiting on deck (chances are draft from your favorite Seattle bre
	weries). Free live music 7-9pm\, good food and the annual\, double elimina
	tion\, SBW Corn Hole Tournament that starts off friendly enough ~ then ten
	ds to get serious. How it works is a Rep/Owner/Brewer from each brewery on
	 hand is paired with a non-beer-biz person. Swag prizes abound. We have a 
	lot of space and lots of boards\, so typically everybody gets to play. But
	 if you 100% want to play\, show up closer to 5pm (and/or email Kelly@theG
	rowlerGuys.com).So\, come throw some bags\, drink some great Seattle-based
	 beer\, chum up with industry friends you may already know\, and just hang
	 out for a few hours with other craft-loving guests. It's an Open Party. F
	eel free to invite coworkers &amp\; friends. Great beer\, food\, corn hole
	\, live music\, parking ~ I feel an Underberg coming on...\n\nFrom Seattle

SUMMARY:Nonviolence Training: Can the University be a "House of Peace"?
DTSTAMP:20260301T063742Z
DTSTART:20260304T170000Z
DESCRIPTION:Training with Faculty\, Staff\, and Community: Can the Universi
	ty be a “House of Peace”?\n\nWednesday\, March 4\, 9am-12pm\, with breakfa
	st at 8:30am\n\nOberto Commons\, Sinegal 200\n\n \n\nPope Leo has called o
	n every community across the globe to become a “house of peace.” This work
	shop will use nonviolent tools and exercises to explore what this metaphor
	 could mean in practical terms to Seattle University. Is it already a “hou
	se of peace”? How might it become more of a “house of peace”?\n\n \n\nKen 
	Butigan is a changemaker who has organized campaigns and movements resisti
	ng war\, challenging nuclear weapons\, and standing with the unhoused. He 
	was a founder of the Pledge of Resistance\, which mobilized nonviolent dir
	ect action for a decade to end US military intervention in Central America
	. He works with Pace e Bene’s Campaign Nonviolence that mobilizes thousand
	s of actions in the U.S. and around the world every year challenging war\,
	 poverty\, racism\, and environmental destruction. He is a senior advisor 
	to Pax Christi International’s Catholic Institute for Nonviolence based in
	 Rome. He taught for many years in the Peace\, Justice\, and Conflict Stud
	ies Program at DePaul University in Chicago. He hails originally from Seat

	erroir of the state’s most prestigious vineyards—Champoux\, Ciel du Cheval
	\, and Two Blondes—to shine through. \n\nThis is a rare opportunity to tas
	te through a curated selection of their current releases\, which often pul
	l some of the highest critical scores in the country. From their silky\, m
	ineral-driven Bordeaux blends to their supple Merlots\, these are “intelle
	ctual” wines designed for both the cellar and the table. \n\nEvent Highlig
	hts: \n\nThe Wines: A guided tasting of world-class vineyard-designate ble
	nds.\n\nThe Story: Learn about the Vashon Island-based winery’s 35\\+ year
	 commitment to artisanal craft and vineyard primacy.\n\nThe Vibe: A sophis
	ticated yet approachable evening for wine enthusiasts and collectors alike
	.\n\nWhether you are a long-time fan of Chris Camarda’s legendary Sorella 
	or looking to discover why Andrew Will is consistently ranked among the to
	p 100 wineries in the world\, this is a tasting you won’t want to miss.\n\

DESCRIPTION:Join us for Live Music Happy Hour with the Joe Casalini Trio. T
	he Casalini Trio has played happy hours at the Royal Room since 2019. They
	 play laid-back\, swinging versions of great tunes by Duke Ellington\, Bil
	ly Strayhorn\, Hoagie Carmichael\, Phillip Johnston\, and other great Amer
	ican songwriters of the last 100 years. The happy hour usually lasts about
	 an hour and a half. Good drinks\, good people\, good ambience\, and there
	’s never a cover charge\, although the band often encourages donations to 
	local food banks and other worthy causes.\n\nhttps://seatoday.6amcity.com/

DESCRIPTION:Born and raised in Los Angeles\, CA It was not until after grad
	uating high school and moving to Fremont\, NE\, to attend Midland Universi
	ty on scholarship for football that Tyler began to pursue his passion for 
	music with vigor. After graduating\, he relocated to Seattle\, WA in the s
	ummer of 2017\, where he currently resides and has been making impressive 
	leaps and bounds in his songwriting\, performing\, and overall musical ide
	ntity during his time in the PNW. His creative spin on past and present ex
	periences breeds songs that lyrically offer a sensationalized window into 
	his life. Tyler boasts powerful vocal performances that mix rich styles of
	 Americana and Alternative Country music with Southern Rock and a fresh tw
	ist of soulful melodies. His music will have you singing along to a good t
	ime drinking song\, reminiscing about long lost love and the regretful or 
	questionable choices of your past\, then leave you feeling uplifted\, refr
	eshed\, and in an all around good mood.\n\nhttps://www.perihelion.beer/eve
