DESCRIPTION:Written By Melanie Godsey For grades K–5 | 1-hour presentation 
	including performance and actor-led talkback It’s a tail-wagging time at P
	et School\, where Biscuit the pup and all their furry and feathered friend
	s learn to sit\, stay\, and help a human in need. When things get ruff for
	 Biscuit’s best human friend\, Corey\, it’s time to fetch help. A once-clo
	se friendship has gone to the dogs\, and the bus stop becomes a bullying z
	one. Using every paws-itively clever trick from Pet School\, Biscuit will 
	stop at nothing to help Corey and teach the other kids that being an upsta
	nder is the best trick of all. Education Goals: Bullying prevention Turnin
	g bystanders into upstanders Overcoming failure Teamwork\n\nhttps://web.ov
