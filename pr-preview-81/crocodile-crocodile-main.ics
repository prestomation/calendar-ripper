DESCRIPTION:maye and Ambar Lucid come together for a joint tour that celebr
	ates emotional honesty\, cultural duality\, and the power of intimacy on s
	tage.Born in Venezuela and based in the US\, maye has built a devoted glob
	al following through deeply personal songwriting that blends Latin roots\,
	 indie pop\, and alternative soul. Her music feels diaristic yet expansive
	\, anchored by vulnerability\, warmth\, and a voice that invites listeners
	 inward rather than pushing outward.Ambar Lucid\, a Mexican-Dominican arti
	st raised between cultures\, brings a hypnotic\, cinematic presence that f
	uses psychedelic pop\, dreamlike visuals\, and bilingual storytelling. Her
	 work explores identity\, intuition\, and self-discovery\, pairing etherea
	l production with striking lyricism that resonates across borders.Together
	\, maye and Ambar Lucid create a shared live experience that feels intimat
	e\, immersive\, and emotionally charged. This tour is not about spectacle 
	for spectacles sake\, but about connection. Two artists\, two worlds\, and
	 one space where language\, culture\, and feeling dissolve into something
