SUMMARY:Know Your Rights Canvass

Training and materials will be provided! \nAlso\, please familiarize yourself with these SPS Migrant Solidarity Resources and WASIN’s Know Your Rights information.

SUMMARY:Local Council Meeting
DESCRIPTION:The Local Council (LC) is the elected leadership body which serves the members of Seattle DSA. During these short weekly check-ins\, LC members will primarily be ensuring work is on track\, though pressing business may occasionally be discussed and voted on. Members are welcome to observe LC meetings by RSVPing here. \nThe LC has an informal check-in meeting every Tuesday (except the fourth Tuesday of the month for the GMMs) from 7:00pm – 7:45pm over Zoom. \nIf there’s something specific you’d like to bring to the Local Council\, please fill out the LC Request Form which can be found on the private resources page of our website. \nIf you are a member that has not yet been added to our Slack (which is required to log in to the private resources page)\, you can request to be added here. \nPlease note that on rare occurrences\, LC meetings will be cancelled due to holidays or unusual circumstances and these changes may not always be reflected on this calendar — if you show up to the meeting and aren’t let in after 5 minutes\, that is almost certainly what has happened.
