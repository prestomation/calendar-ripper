DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wished you could go inside of a book? You could t
	ravel to a new place\\\, see new sights\\\, potentially live a different l
	ife altogether — all from the page. \\nFrom New York Times bestselling aut
	hor Kate Quinn comes Astral Library\\\, a fantastical novel where books ar
	e not merely objects\\\, but doors to different worlds\\\, different adven
	tures\\\, and different futures. \\nAfter growing up in the foster care sy
	stem\\\, protagonist Alix Watson came to believe one thing: unlike people\
	\\, books will never let you down. Working three dead-end jobs to make end
	s meet and letting her dreams of higher education fall to the wayside\\\, 
	Alix takes refuge in the reading room at the Boston Public Library\\\, rea
	ding her favorite fantasy novels and dreaming of faraway lands night after
	 night. One day\\\, she stumbles through a hidden door and meets the Libra
	rian: the ageless guardian of the Astral Library\\\, where the desperate a
	nd the lost escape to new lives inside their favorite books. All seems wel
	l until a shadowy enemy emerges and threatens everyone inside. \\nAs dange
	r draws closer\\\, Alix and the Librarian try to escape\\\, fleeing places
	 like the back alleys of the Sherlock Holmes series\\\, the Regency-era dr
	awing rooms of Jane Austen\\\, and the decadent parties of The Great Gatsb
	y\\\, to name a few. In journeying through books\\\, Quinn may offer insig
	ht into where readers truly belong.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

SUMMARY:Emily Galvin Almanza with Michele Storms
DTSTAMP:20260220T081049Z
DTSTART:20260221T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered what really goes on in our country’s cri
	minal courts? Many want to believe in the hallowed halls of justice\\\, wi
	th ethical and equitable legal processes that pursue truth and enforce the
	 law fairly. But one author argues that this perception hides the reality 
	that the system is broken. \\nEmily Galvin Almanza\\\, also a former publi
	c defender\\\, presents her latest work The Price of Mercy: Unfair Trials\
	\\, a Violent System\\\, and a Public Defender’s Search for Justice in Ame
	rica. The text takes us behind closed doors of America’s criminal courts\\
	\, arguing that the institutions that claim to protect us are doing the ex
	act opposite. Examples include data showing that jails actually increase f
	uture crime\\\, police corruption in overtime pay\\\, an example of a man 
	incarcerated for decades because scientists mistook dog hair for his own\\
	\, incentives that push prosecutors to seek convictions\\\, and even how j
	udges may decide cases differently after lunch. \\nAlmanza presents exampl
	es and offers a blueprint for fixing these issues at their core\\\, and by
	 engaging the general public in helping to shape our collective future.\n\

SUMMARY:Judith Enck with Bellamy Pailthorp
DTSTAMP:20260220T081049Z
DTSTART:20260222T140000Z
DESCRIPTION:In less than 100 years\\\, plastic has gone from a novel invent
	ion to a ubiquitous feature across the globe. Plastic is now found in ever
	ything from household objects to industrial mechanisms to inside human bod
	ies themselves. Once a marvel of modern science\\\, plastic has become so 
	inextricably woven into our lives that imagining a world without it can se
	em impossible. \\nBacked by years of research and reflections taking place
	 in real time with changing technology and environmental awareness\\\, The
	 Problem with Plastic critically examines the paradox of this material and
	 how swiftly its integration has affected public health and the planet as 
	a whole. The book explores how\\\, despite being first celebrated for its 
	innovations\\\, plastic is now broadly recognized as a leading contributor
	 to environmental pollution at every level\\\, the climate crisis\\\, and 
	building waste levels that disproportionately impact marginalized communit
	ies that bear the brunt of petrochemical pollution. \\nAuthor and environm
	ental policy expert Judith Enck\\\, in collaboration with co-author Adam M
	ahoney and the Beyond Plastics project\\\, strives to draw attention to th
	e alarming extent that microplastics have infiltrated society and the ways
	 consumers can challenge what they think about the roles they can play. Un
	packing illusions about recycling\\\, mechanisms of environmental racism\\
	\, and deceptive greenwashing strategies\\\, the authors emphasize the urg
	ency of calling for real\\\, actionable measures to push against the effec
	ts of the plastics industry. The Problem with Plastic highlights powerful 
	stories of frontline resistance in places like Louisiana\\\, Texas\\\, and
	 Appalachia\\\, and seeks to equip readers with practical tools– including
	 a “Household Waste Audit” to track and reduce plastic consumption and mod
	el policy guides for driving legislative change. Fortified with calls for 
	individual responsibility\\\, citizen action\\\, and governmental regulati
	ons\\\, The Problem with Plastic aims to show that while plastic is a form
	idable problem\\\, coordinated efforts can lead to solutions.\n\nFrom Town

SUMMARY:George Conway III
DTSTAMP:20260220T081049Z
DTSTART:20260225T183000Z
DESCRIPTION:This talk will explore the idea that the endurance of the rule 
	of law in the United States relies not solely on the provisions of the Con
	stitution—its structural framework\\\, the institutions it established\\\,
	 or the rights it enshrines—but fundamentally on the character of its citi
	zens. Qualities such as public-spiritedness\\\, tolerance\\\, moderation\\
	\, empathy\\\, mutual respect\\\, a sense of fair play\\\, and\\\, ultimat
	ely\\\, intelligence\\\, honor\\\, and decency form the foundation of cons
	titutional democracy. \\nEchoing Benjamin Franklin’s cautionary remark—“A 
	republic\\\, if you can keep it”—the talk reflects on how the republic now
	 faces one of its most precarious moments. The threat\\\, the speaker cont
	ends\\\, does not stem from any single individual\\\, not even the Preside
	nt of the United States\\\, but rather from the pervasive political disqui
	et within a large segment of the electorate. \\nA change in administration
	 in 2021 did not resolve this underlying ailment\\\, and a future shift in
	 2029 will not remedy it either—unless those who grasp the importance of c
	onstitutionalism and the rule of law can meaningfully convey to others tha
	t the preservation of their rights depends on their willingness to uphold 
	the rights of others. The presentation will conclude with a discussion on 
	whether—and how—such civic understanding can be rekindled.\n\nFrom Town Ha

SUMMARY:Andrew Yang with Jonathan Sposato
DTSTAMP:20260220T081049Z
DTSTART:20260227T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Remember that one time in 2019 when presidential candidate Andr
	ew Yang promised a thousand dollars a month for a whole year to ten U.S. f
	amilies if they donated to his campaign? Yang would like to address this. 
	Pulling from his latest book titled Hey Yang\\\, Where’s My Thousand Bucks
	?\\\, Yang shares stories from his remarkable life so far\\\, including th
	is viral moment during a live presidential debate. \\nBeyond championing u
	niversal basic income\\\, Yang would like to bring a little humor into the
	 world. In his candid and playful accounts\\\, Yang examines where the U.S
	. sits today through the lens of his unexpected journey from entrepreneur 
	to presidential candidate. Part political memoir\\\, part comedy\\\, and p
	art interior monologue\\\, his stories attempt to make complex ideas acces
	sible and entertaining. \\nIt’s this entertainment that he sees as a unify
	ing potential. Yang believes in the power of laughter\\\, even in — and ma
	ybe especially in — trying times. For anyone frustrated with traditional p
	olitical narratives\\\, curious about the human behind the headlines\\\, o
	r simply looking for a light-hearted exploration of trying to improve life
	 in the U.S.\\\, Yang wants to enlighten\\\, entertain\\\, and inspire. It
	’s through this optimism\\\, Yang hopes\\\, that we can create real positi
	ve change.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

SUMMARY:Lauren Groff with Amber Flame
DTSTAMP:20260220T081049Z
DTSTART:20260301T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Whether you know her from her short stories in The New Yorker o
	r The Atlantic or from one of her bestselling novels\\\, Lauren Groff is a
	rguably one of the leading literary voices in the U.S. Groff will share fr
	om her new collection of short stories\\\, Brawler\\\, which reflects upon
	 humanity’s ceaseless battle between our dark and light angels. \\nRanging
	 from the 1950s to the present day and moving across age\\\, class\\\, and
	 region––from New England to Florida to California––the nine stories in Gr
	off’s newest collection dive into the animal and the divine within us all.
	 \\nThe characters paint a different picture of the same theme: a young wo
	man suddenly responsible for her disabled sibling\; a hot-tempered high sc
	hool swimmer in need of an adult\; a mother blinded by the loss of her fam
	ily\; and a banking successor with a different kind of inheritance. Motiva
	ted by love\\\, challenged by the double edges of other people’s good inte
	ntions\\\, they all try to do the right thing for as long as they can. It’
	s through these stories that Groff illuminates what it means to be human. 
	\\nGroff’s popularity comes from her insight into human nature. Through he
	r various stories\\\, Brawler offers specific turning points in people’s l
	ives\\\, highlighting all of our thin boundaries between love and fear\\\,
	 compassion and violence\\\, reason and instinct\\\, altruism and what it 
	takes to survive.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle

SUMMARY:Michael Pollan with Jon Mooallem
DTSTAMP:20260220T081049Z
DTSTART:20260302T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to the phenomenon that is consciousness\\\, there
	 is one point on which scientists\\\, philosophers\\\, and artists all agr
	ee: it feels like something to be us. Yet the fact that we have a subjecti
	ve experience of the world remains one of nature’s greatest mysteries. How
	 is it that our mental operations are accompanied by feelings\\\, thoughts
	\\\, and a sense of self? What would a scientific investigation of our inn
	er life look like when we have as little distance and perspective on it as
	 fish do of the sea? In A World Appears\\\, Michael Pollan traces the unma
	pped continent that is consciousness\\\, bringing radically different pers
	pectives—scientific\\\, philosophical\\\, literary\\\, spiritual\\\, and p

DTSTART:20260314T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Solstice Symphony Orchestra returns on March 14 with a FREE Sat
	urday evening concert. This performance also marks the debut of Solstice C
	amerata\\\, a new chamber-orchestra ensemble dedicated to repertoire writt
	en for smaller orchestral forces. \\nAdmission is free\; tickets are requi
	red. \\nTitled American Echoes\\\, the concert will explore the “American 
	sound” across time\\\, space\\\, and perspectives. The program opens with 
	Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Symphony No. 25\\\, which was composed the same 
	year that the Boston Tea Party took place in the US (1773)\\\, situating i
	ts urgency and unrest within a wider moment of philosophical and political
	 upheaval. The program then turns to four unique American voices from diff
	erent eras and backgrounds — Charles Ives\\\, Florence Price\\\, Caroline 
	Shaw\\\, and Aaron Copland — whose music engages with shared themes of dou
	bt and devotion\\\, inheritance and reinvention\\\, intimacy and expansive
	ness. \\nPerformed by a reduced ensemble in a chamber-orchestra setting\\\
	, American Echoes invites close listening and rewards reflection. Admissio
	n is free and open to all\; tickets are required and will be available in 
	advance. \\nThis program is supported\\\, in part\\\, by a grant from the 
	Washington State Arts Commission.\n\nFrom Town Hall Seattle
