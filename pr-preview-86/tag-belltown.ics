	al following through deeply personal songwriting that blends Latin roots\,
	 indie pop\, and alternative soul. Her music feels diaristic yet expansive
	\, anchored by vulnerability\, warmth\, and a voice that invites listeners
	 inward rather than pushing outward.Ambar Lucid\, a Mexican-Dominican arti
	st raised between cultures\, brings a hypnotic\, cinematic presence that f
	uses psychedelic pop\, dreamlike visuals\, and bilingual storytelling. Her
	 work explores identity\, intuition\, and self-discovery\, pairing etherea
	l production with striking lyricism that resonates across borders.Together
	\, maye and Ambar Lucid create a shared live experience that feels intimat
	e\, immersive\, and emotionally charged. This tour is not about spectacle 
	for spectacles sake\, but about connection. Two artists\, two worlds\, and
	 one space where language\, culture\, and feeling dissolve into something 
	singular and unforgettable.\nAll sales are final. There are no refunds unl
