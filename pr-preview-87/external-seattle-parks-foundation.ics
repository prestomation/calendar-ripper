As we gain a deeper understanding of these impacts\, how we address them and find opportunities\, will shape our region’s future. \nSymposium Objective: To share knowledge and lessons learned from the first initial Duwamish River habitat restoration projects to new ones\, through the evolution of 20 years of challenging river restoration understanding and experience. \nConvene restoration practitioners\, planners\, youth\, and other interested groups to share lessons learned\, successes\, and technical knowledge from large restoration efforts in a welcoming and inclusive environment to promote sharing and new perspectives. \nLearn more + register \nLearn more about Duwamish Alive Coalition here.

SUMMARY:Daybreak Star Forest Garden Land Tending: Tending Our Future
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Daybreak Star. \nThese gatherings are a place to return to the land\, to reconnect with Indigenous teachings\, and to be in community with each other in ways that are rooted\, relational\, and real. They’re about Indigenous food sovereignty\, cultural memory\, and reclaiming the right to care for land in the ways our ancestors always have. \nLed by community members and organizers with United Indians of All Tribes Foundation\, this work centers Indigenous knowledge systems and relationships with land that have existed here since time immemorial—and that continue\, despite every attempt to erase them. \nThe Forest Garden is growing with care—planted with camas\, salmonberry\, huckleberry\, wild strawberry\, nettle\, cedar\, and other Native plants that are more than food and medicine—they’re our teachers\, our elders\, and our ancestors. \nThese plants are being tended not just for harvest\, but to support the many Indigenous-centered programs at UIATF: elder meals\, youth programming\, cultural wellness\, and more. This is one way we practice sovereignty—by feeding ourselves\, our people\, and our spirits in alignment with our values. \nIn a time when many of us are searching for where to belong and how to show up—this is a space to meet one another\, build real relationships\, and map the power we already hold together. \nLet’s gather not just to work the land—but to connect\, share our stories\, and remember that we are each other’s safety\, each other’s strength\, and each other’s solution. \nRegister

SUMMARY:Kubota forest work - always ivy!
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Kubota Gardens Natural Area. \nSo much ivy! Every month\, volunteers make a big difference by removing ivy so that trees\, bushes\, ferns and other native plants have room to grow.

No experience is needed – just bring your energy and interest in making a difference! \nRegister

SUMMARY:Daybreak Star Forest Garden Land Tending: Tending Our Future
DESCRIPTION:Join us for a restoration work party at Daybreak Star. \nThese gatherings are a place to return to the land\, to reconnect with Indigenous teachings\, and to be in community with each other in ways that are rooted\, relational\, and real. They’re about Indigenous food sovereignty\, cultural memory\, and reclaiming the right to care for land in the ways our ancestors always have. \nLed by community members and organizers with United Indians of All Tribes Foundation\, this work centers Indigenous knowledge systems and relationships with land that have existed here since time immemorial—and that continue\, despite every attempt to erase them. \nThe Forest Garden is growing with care—planted with camas\, salmonberry\, huckleberry\, wild strawberry\, nettle\, cedar\, and other Native plants that are more than food and medicine—they’re our teachers\, our elders\, and our ancestors. \nThese plants are being tended not just for harvest\, but to support the many Indigenous-centered programs at UIATF: elder meals\, youth programming\, cultural wellness\, and more. This is one way we practice sovereignty—by feeding ourselves\, our people\, and our spirits in alignment with our values. \nIn a time when many of us are searching for where to belong and how to show up—this is a space to meet one another\, build real relationships\, and map the power we already hold together. \nLet’s gather not just to work the land—but to connect\, share our stories\, and remember that we are each other’s safety\, each other’s strength\, and each other’s solution. \nRegister
