	ing for interconnected scenes inspired by your suggestions\\\, friends ove
	rshare and spiral\\\, romantic gestures go wrong\\\, awkward silences stre
	tch\\\, and small problems become big ones. The comedy comes from characte
	r and relationship\\\, building through sharp dialogue\\\, escalating tens
	ion\\\, and recognizable\\\, lived-in situations. Perfect for fans of smar
