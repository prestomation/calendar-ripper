DESCRIPTION:Loose Cannons is Seattle improv at its most unpredictable. Ever

	ally does. \\nPart One: Part One: The night kicks off with a unique perfor
	mance\\\, setting the performers in a new format with special guest improv
	isers showcasing their signature style or a never-before-seen format. Your
	 suggestions fuel the fire\\\, and the improvisers will ignite the stage\\
	\, bringing your ideas to life. \\nPart Two: The second half launches from
	 a single audience suggestion\\\, setting the performers in motion. It mig
	ht start with a song\\\, a monologue\\\, or a rapid-fire group connection 
	game. Whatever emerges will inspire spontaneous stories\\\, surprising twi
	sts\\\, and big comedic swings. \\nLoose Cannons is fueled by audience ide
	as\\\, fearless performers\\\, and the thrill of not knowing what happens 
	next. You light the fuse. They run with it. What they create is entirely u
