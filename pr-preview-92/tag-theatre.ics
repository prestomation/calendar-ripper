SUMMARY:Seattle Suites: An Improvised Neil Simon Comedy

DTSTART:20260307T193000Z
DESCRIPTION:Improvised comedy in the style of Neil Simon\\\, where one hote
	l suite becomes a comedic pressure cooker for 3 hilarious improvised tales
	\\n\\n\\n\\nOne hotel suite. Countless misunderstandings. Relentless laugh
	s. \\nSeattle Suite is a laugh-driven\\\, fully improvised play inspired b
	y the style of Plaza Suite and California Suite\\\, capturing the signatur
	e humor of Neil Simon that is fast\\\, verbal\\\, and rooted in beautifull
	y human flaws. Each night\\\, a single Seattle hotel room becomes the sett
	ing for interconnected scenes inspired by your suggestions\\\, friends ove
	rshare and spiral\\\, romantic gestures go wrong\\\, awkward silences stre
	tch\\\, and small problems become big ones. The comedy comes from characte
	r and relationship\\\, building through sharp dialogue\\\, escalating tens
	ion\\\, and recognizable\\\, lived-in situations. Perfect for fans of smar
	t comedy\\\, relationship humor\\\, and classic theatrical wit.\n\nFrom Un
