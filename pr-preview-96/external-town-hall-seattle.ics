SUMMARY:Kate Quinn with Elise Hooper
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wished you could go inside of a book? You could travel to a new place\, see new sights\, potentially live a different life altogether — all from the page. \nFrom New York Times bestselling author Kate Quinn comes Astral Library\, a fantastical novel where books are not merely objects\, but doors to different worlds\, different adventures\, and different futures. \nAfter growing up in the foster care system\, protagonist Alix Watson came to believe one thing: unlike people\, books will never let you down. Working three dead-end jobs to make ends meet and letting her dreams of higher education fall to the wayside\, Alix takes refuge in the reading room at the Boston Public Library\, reading her favorite fantasy novels and dreaming of faraway lands night after night. One day\, she stumbles through a hidden door and meets the Librarian: the ageless guardian of the Astral Library\, where the desperate and the lost escape to new lives inside their favorite books. All seems well until a shadowy enemy emerges and threatens everyone inside. \nAs danger draws closer\, Alix and the Librarian try to escape\, fleeing places like the back alleys of the Sherlock Holmes series\, the Regency-era drawing rooms of Jane Austen\, and the decadent parties of The Great Gatsby\, to name a few. In journeying through books\, Quinn may offer insight into where readers truly belong.

SUMMARY:Emily Galvin Almanza with Michele Storms
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered what really goes on in our country’s criminal courts? Many want to believe in the hallowed halls of justice\, with ethical and equitable legal processes that pursue truth and enforce the law fairly. But one author argues that this perception hides the reality that the system is broken. \nEmily Galvin Almanza\, also a former public defender\, presents her latest work The Price of Mercy: Unfair Trials\, a Violent System\, and a Public Defender’s Search for Justice in America. The text takes us behind closed doors of America’s criminal courts\, arguing that the institutions that claim to protect us are doing the exact opposite. Examples include data showing that jails actually increase future crime\, police corruption in overtime pay\, an example of a man incarcerated for decades because scientists mistook dog hair for his own\, incentives that push prosecutors to seek convictions\, and even how judges may decide cases differently after lunch. \nAlmanza presents examples and offers a blueprint for fixing these issues at their core\, and by engaging the general public in helping to shape our collective future.

SUMMARY:Judith Enck with Bellamy Pailthorp
DESCRIPTION:In less than 100 years\, plastic has gone from a novel invention to a ubiquitous feature across the globe. Plastic is now found in everything from household objects to industrial mechanisms to inside human bodies themselves. Once a marvel of modern science\, plastic has become so inextricably woven into our lives that imagining a world without it can seem impossible. \nBacked by years of research and reflections taking place in real time with changing technology and environmental awareness\, The Problem with Plastic critically examines the paradox of this material and how swiftly its integration has affected public health and the planet as a whole. The book explores how\, despite being first celebrated for its innovations\, plastic is now broadly recognized as a leading contributor to environmental pollution at every level\, the climate crisis\, and building waste levels that disproportionately impact marginalized communities that bear the brunt of petrochemical pollution. \nAuthor and environmental policy expert Judith Enck\, in collaboration with co-author Adam Mahoney and the Beyond Plastics project\, strives to draw attention to the alarming extent that microplastics have infiltrated society and the ways consumers can challenge what they think about the roles they can play. Unpacking illusions about recycling\, mechanisms of environmental racism\, and deceptive greenwashing strategies\, the authors emphasize the urgency of calling for real\, actionable measures to push against the effects of the plastics industry. The Problem with Plastic highlights powerful stories of frontline resistance in places like Louisiana\, Texas\, and Appalachia\, and seeks to equip readers with practical tools– including a “Household Waste Audit” to track and reduce plastic consumption and model policy guides for driving legislative change. Fortified with calls for individual responsibility\, citizen action\, and governmental regulations\, The Problem with Plastic aims to show that while plastic is a formidable problem\, coordinated efforts can lead to solutions.

SUMMARY:George Conway III
DESCRIPTION:This talk will explore the idea that the endurance of the rule of law in the United States relies not solely on the provisions of the Constitution—its structural framework\, the institutions it established\, or the rights it enshrines—but fundamentally on the character of its citizens. Qualities such as public-spiritedness\, tolerance\, moderation\, empathy\, mutual respect\, a sense of fair play\, and\, ultimately\, intelligence\, honor\, and decency form the foundation of constitutional democracy. \nEchoing Benjamin Franklin’s cautionary remark—“A republic\, if you can keep it”—the talk reflects on how the republic now faces one of its most precarious moments. The threat\, the speaker contends\, does not stem from any single individual\, not even the President of the United States\, but rather from the pervasive political disquiet within a large segment of the electorate. \nA change in administration in 2021 did not resolve this underlying ailment\, and a future shift in 2029 will not remedy it either—unless those who grasp the importance of constitutionalism and the rule of law can meaningfully convey to others that the preservation of their rights depends on their willingness to uphold the rights of others. The presentation will conclude with a discussion on whether—and how—such civic understanding can be rekindled.

SUMMARY:Andrew Yang with Jonathan Sposato
DESCRIPTION:Remember that one time in 2019 when presidential candidate Andrew Yang promised a thousand dollars a month for a whole year to ten U.S. families if they donated to his campaign? Yang would like to address this. Pulling from his latest book titled Hey Yang\, Where’s My Thousand Bucks?\, Yang shares stories from his remarkable life so far\, including this viral moment during a live presidential debate. \nBeyond championing universal basic income\, Yang would like to bring a little humor into the world. In his candid and playful accounts\, Yang examines where the U.S. sits today through the lens of his unexpected journey from entrepreneur to presidential candidate. Part political memoir\, part comedy\, and part interior monologue\, his stories attempt to make complex ideas accessible and entertaining. \nIt’s this entertainment that he sees as a unifying potential. Yang believes in the power of laughter\, even in — and maybe especially in — trying times. For anyone frustrated with traditional political narratives\, curious about the human behind the headlines\, or simply looking for a light-hearted exploration of trying to improve life in the U.S.\, Yang wants to enlighten\, entertain\, and inspire. It’s through this optimism\, Yang hopes\, that we can create real positive change.

SUMMARY:Lauren Groff with Amber Flame
DESCRIPTION:Whether you know her from her short stories in The New Yorker or The Atlantic or from one of her bestselling novels\, Lauren Groff is arguably one of the leading literary voices in the U.S. Groff will share from her new collection of short stories\, Brawler\, which reflects upon humanity’s ceaseless battle between our dark and light angels. \nRanging from the 1950s to the present day and moving across age\, class\, and region––from New England to Florida to California––the nine stories in Groff’s newest collection dive into the animal and the divine within us all. \nThe characters paint a different picture of the same theme: a young woman suddenly responsible for her disabled sibling; a hot-tempered high school swimmer in need of an adult; a mother blinded by the loss of her family; and a banking successor with a different kind of inheritance. Motivated by love\, challenged by the double edges of other people’s good intentions\, they all try to do the right thing for as long as they can. It’s through these stories that Groff illuminates what it means to be human. \nGroff’s popularity comes from her insight into human nature. Through her various stories\, Brawler offers specific turning points in people’s lives\, highlighting all of our thin boundaries between love and fear\, compassion and violence\, reason and instinct\, altruism and what it takes to survive.

SUMMARY:Michael Pollan with Jon Mooallem
DESCRIPTION:When it comes to the phenomenon that is consciousness\, there is one point on which scientists\, philosophers\, and artists all agree: it feels like something to be us. Yet the fact that we have a subjective experience of the world remains one of nature’s greatest mysteries. How is it that our mental operations are accompanied by feelings\, thoughts\, and a sense of self? What would a scientific investigation of our inner life look like when we have as little distance and perspective on it as fish do of the sea? In A World Appears\, Michael Pollan traces the unmapped continent that is consciousness\, bringing radically different perspectives—scientific\, philosophical\, literary\, spiritual\, and psychedelic—to see what each can teach us about this central fact of life.

SUMMARY:Psychedelic Salon: Psychedelics & Substance Use
DESCRIPTION:Psychedelic therapy is rapidly gaining traction as a promising approach for addressing substance use disorders—from alcohol and opioids to nicotine and beyond. This session will explore how psychedelic compounds like ibogaine\, ketamine\, and psilocybin may help interrupt compulsive cycles\, uncover root causes of addiction\, and support sustained recovery. \nFeaturing Dr. Nathan Sackett of the UW Center for Novel Therapeutics in Addiction Psychiatry\, this conversation will examine how pairing psychedelic compounds with evidence-based behavioral interventions could transform the treatment of addiction. Drawing on his team’s cautious\, research-driven approach\, Dr. Sackett will discuss what’s known\, what remains to be discovered\, and how rigorous clinical study can help bring safe\, effective psychedelic-assisted therapies to those who need them most.

SUMMARY:St. Vincent (SOLD OUT)
DESCRIPTION:Annie Clark made her recorded debut as St. Vincent in 2007 with Marry Me\, quickly becoming regarded as one of the most innovative and fascinating presences in modern music. Her subsequent albums would include Actor (2009)\, Strange Mercy (2011)\, her self-titled fourth album\, and winner of the 2014 GRAMMY for Best Alternative Album. In 2017\, her fifth album MASS EDUCTION would break St. Vincent into the U.S. and UK top 10s and win two more GRAMMYs (Best Rock Song for its title track\, and Best Recording Package). 2021’s Daddy’s Home found St. Vincent channeling the hungover glamor and gritty sepia-toned soundtrack of 1970s downtown NYC to an ecstatic reception\, ultimately winning her a second Best Alternative Album GRAMMY.

SUMMARY:Evelyn Iritani with Frank Abe
DESCRIPTION:Across the water from Seattle\, you can visit the Bainbridge Island Japanese American Exclusion Memorial. It’s a place to honor and learn from the past. Evelyn Iritani\, a longtime Seattle resident and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist\, wants to remember – and learn from – another\, lesser-known story from World War II. In her book\, Safe Passage\, she reveals the dramatic\, behind-the-scenes efforts to bring U.S. and Japanese citizens home from enemy land. \nIn 1943\, during some of the Pacific theater’s bloodiest battles\, the United States and Japan coordinated the exchange of civilians caught on the wrong side of the battlefield after Pearl Harbor. Nearly fifteen hundred Allied civilians trapped in Asia\, mostly U.S. citizens\, sailed through dangerous waters to India\, where they were traded for Japanese immigrants sent from the U.S. The fate of the more than ten thousand U.S. civilians left behind in Asia rested on the success of this endeavor.

SUMMARY:Crowdsource Choir

SUMMARY:American Echoes
DESCRIPTION:Solstice Symphony Orchestra returns on March 14 with a FREE Saturday evening concert. This performance also marks the debut of Solstice Camerata\, a new chamber-orchestra ensemble dedicated to repertoire written for smaller orchestral forces. \nAdmission is free; tickets are required. \nTitled American Echoes\, the concert will explore the “American sound” across time\, space\, and perspectives. The program opens with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s Symphony No. 25\, which was composed the same year that the Boston Tea Party took place in the US (1773)\, situating its urgency and unrest within a wider moment of philosophical and political upheaval. The program then turns to four unique American voices from different eras and backgrounds — Charles Ives\, Florence Price\, Caroline Shaw\, and Aaron Copland — whose music engages with shared themes of doubt and devotion\, inheritance and reinvention\, intimacy and expansiveness. \nPerformed by a reduced ensemble in a chamber-orchestra setting\, American Echoes invites close listening and rewards reflection. Admission is free and open to all; tickets are required and will be available in advance. \nThis program is supported\, in part\, by a grant from the Washington State Arts Commission.

SUMMARY:Matthew Sutton with Bill Radke
DESCRIPTION:Whether or not you call yourself religious\, there’s no denying that religion has an impact on society across the continents. And there is no faith more dominant than Christianity in the United States today. Washington State University professor and historian Matthew A. Sutton can show you just exactly how evangelical Christianity entwines itself with all aspects of the country. Drawing from his book\, Chosen Land: How Christianity Made America and Americans Remade Christianity\, Sutton chronicles Christians’ five-hundred-year endeavor to turn the U.S. into their version of the kingdom of God.

SUMMARY:David Pogue
DESCRIPTION:Do you own an iPhone or other Apple product? If you don’t\, chances are that you know someone who does. Although the present ubiquity of Apple is well-known\, how much do you know about its past? Just in time for Apple’s 50th anniversary\, author and CBS correspondent David Pogue tells the history of the iconic company: how it was born\, nearly died\, and was revived under the legendary Steve Jobs\, and how it later became the most valuable company in the world. \nOn April 1\, 1976\, two men in their 20s\, both named Steve\, founded a modest startup. Their goal was to bring the power of computers to everyone. Over the next five decades\, Apple revolutionized the tech landscape\, introducing the public to many products that we use today and marrying technology with design. \nWith in-depth research and illustrations\, Apple: The First 50 Years includes new interviews with 150 key figures\, including Steve Wozniak\, John Sculley\, Jony Ive\, and many current engineers\, executives\, and designers. Stories of frenetic all-nighters\, creative rebellion\, and innovation offer readers a backstage look the titanic successes (450 million iPods\, 700 million iPads\, 2.2 billion iPhones) and colossal failures (Lisa\, Apple III\, MobileMe) that mark a half century of Apple devices. Pogue’s book also attempts to dispel myths\, clarifying the past and evaluating Apple’s position in the future as it enters the next 50 years.

SUMMARY:Cindy Cohn
DESCRIPTION:As we cascade further into the digital age\, concerns over privacy and data security continue to rise with increasing urgency. As artificial intelligence expands its reach\, vast aggregates of personal data are constantly being mined to refine future models. But\, the fight for digital privacy is as old as the digital age itself. In Privacy’s Defender: My Thirty-Year Fight Against Digital Surveillance\, author and Digital Rights Activist\, Cindy Cohn\, chronicles her career-long battle to preserve our right to privacy online. \nPart memoir and part legal history for a general audience\, Privacy’s Defender reminds the reader just how hard-won the privacy rights we enjoy today were. Cohn stresses the societal importance of digital privacy\, citing its role in combatting authoritarianism\, organizing public protests\, and reinforcing other human rights as well.
