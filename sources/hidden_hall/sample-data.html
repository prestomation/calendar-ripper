Frames embodies the spirit of a band riding a creative wave, sharing art through four unique windows, with a depth and character that feels fresh and vital. There is great joy in listening to this band of lifelong friends, as they playfully meld their distinct musical personalities into one cohesive and beautiful voice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inspired by the energy of their live performances, Steve Adams (bass, vocals), Zach Gill (vocals, keys), Dan \u201cLebo\u201d Lebowitz (guitar, vocals), and Ezra Lipp (drums, vocals) entered a studio wonderland in the summer of 2024, alongside close friend and studio collaborator, David Simon-Baker (aka,\u201cDSB\u201d). Ten tracks were collectively born, exploring themes of connection and reflection, balancing optimism, humor, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of Frames emerged organically during the recording process. \u201cThe idea of frames \u2013 both literal and metaphorical \u2013 kept popping up in different ways,\u201d says Gill. This theme is explored in tracks like the Lebo-penned future-pop-disco anthem \u201cSpace Between Frames,\u201d which reflects on moments of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cSo often we find ourselves trapped in a warp-speed life with frames of information coming at us faster than fire,\u201d says Lebo. \u201cSome of it\u2019s inspiring and some of it\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s all so rapid paced that we just can\u2019t keep up. The space between frames is about finding that quiet place without so much noise, where we can actually reflect on what we want to be and what we want to offer the world.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album\u2019s first single and lead-off album track, \u201cBlank Canvas,\u201d written by Gill, sets the tone with its dreamy, feel-good anthem of optimism and adventure. \u201cIt\u2019s about looking at the world with fresh eyes and leaving behind cynicism,\u201d explains Gill. Adams adds, \u201cSonically and thematically, it felt like the perfect beginning. Bare and vulnerable, yet full of possibility.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of his own composition &#034;Separated, Come Together,\u201d Adams ruminates, \u201cafter many days of word-wrestling, I ended up with this simple little rocker, depicting a day on the town, people-watching, letting the mind untangle, getting lost in the stars and accepting that life\u2019s connections are just a mess of rubber bands. A song about appreciating our moments together and trusting more will come.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On \u201cRescue Our Demons\u201d Lipp explains \u201cthe song reflects the idea of not just confronting our darker instincts, but learning to live with them, even embrace them.\u201d \u201cHey Hello (Tale Of The Twist and Shout),\u201d another Gill composition, \u201cwas inspired by our 2024 summer tour of Colorado mountain towns and all the colorful characters who came out to dance &lt;br /&gt;and sing with us under the stars. It\u2019s a greeting, a campfire conversation, and an ole\u2019 &lt;br /&gt;time-y hoedown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cALO is a California rock n\u2019 roll institution, going on over 30 years, and it is the most egalitarian band I have ever been a part of,\u201d says Lipp. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the reasons for its longevity.\u201d ALO\u2019s biography is a timeless, feel-good rock n\u2019 roll musical love story. California natives Lebowitz, Adams and Gill joined forces in junior high in the \u201880s, stayed together throughout their years at UC Santa Barbara in the \u201890s, returned home to the San Francisco Bay Area in the \u201800s, and have cultivated a devoted following over the course of decades, keeping the band in high demand at venues and festivals worldwide. Ezra Lipp has held down the drum seat for over 7 years, with Frames being his second full length album with the band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all four members of the quartet spend time outside of ALO playing with luminary artists such as Jack Johnson, Phil Lesh, Bob Weir, and Nicki Bluhm, it is within the framework of ALO that these four musicians really shine. Individually, each band member writes and sings, and together they create an eclectic yet accessible blend of heartfelt song-craft, dance-floor booty beats, and expansive improvisations. ALO is more than just a band, it\u2019s the comfort of lifelong friendships, the spontaneity of late-night road trips and the discovery of treasures hidden in car seats, green rooms and buried voice memos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frames feels both old and new, fresh and classic. It\u2019s a powerful and engaging statement and step forward for ALO. It\u2019s a beautiful sounding record, with depth and character that balances the emotion, musicality and touches of clever humor in a new way for the group. It holds dreams in its folds, and possibilities in its frames. \u201cNow we get to go out into the world with these 10 new songs, share them with people, and let them develop on stage,\u201d says Lebo. \u201cGetting to know them and letting them grow on the road is really exciting for all of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with selfies and the claims of overindulged individualists, it\u2019s a joy listening to this band of lifelong friends as they work together, playfully melding their distinct musical personalities into one cohesive and beautiful voice. A voice that is ALO.&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/41f3ea2d-b63b-4e80-b902-6d6d0f426613.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/alo-with-special-guest-mimi-naja-of-fruition--161013","startDate":"2026-02-21T04:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-02-21T10:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/alo-with-special-guest-mimi-naja-of-fruition--161013","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":30,"validFrom":"2025-12-02T18:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-02-20T08:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Swavy w/ Hard Maybe, Hot Bodies in Motion, Clambrain","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;2.21.26 Saturday (Indie-Funk/Jazz/Soul)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall Presents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swavy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;w/ Hard Maybe, Hot Bodies in Motion, Clambrain&lt;br /&gt;8:00PM doors&lt;br /&gt;8:30PM show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/e7ee9fd9-051e-4809-9470-beb0f908675a.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/swavy-w-hard-maybe-hot-bodies-in-motion-clambrain-169228","startDate":"2026-02-22T04:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-02-22T10:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Hidden Hall","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/swavy-w-hard-maybe-hot-bodies-in-motion-clambrain-169228","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":15,"validFrom":"2025-12-14T22:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-02-21T08:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Ruston Way w/ Sleepy Cat, Pilot Seat, Actress","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;2.22.26 Sunday (Rock/Indie/Alternative)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall Presents:&lt;br /&gt;Ruston Way&lt;br /&gt;Sleepy Cat&lt;br /&gt;Pilot Seat&lt;br /&gt;Actress&lt;br /&gt;7:00PM doors&lt;br /&gt;7:30PM show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/6bd0ac9a-4433-4bc0-a94c-56b582968cec.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/ruston-way-w-sleepy-cat-pilot-seat-actress-168751","startDate":"2026-02-23T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-02-23T10:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Hidden Hall","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/ruston-way-w-sleepy-cat-pilot-seat-actress-168751","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":30,"validFrom":"2025-12-10T02:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-02-22T08:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"SOCKS IN THE FRYING PAN with guests Countercurrent","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;2.26 Thursday (Irish Folk)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall &amp; The PBJ Present:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOCKS IN THE FRYING PAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with guests Countercurrent&lt;br /&gt;7pm doors&lt;br /&gt;8pm show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Socks in the Frying Pan&lt;/strong&gt;, a multi-award-winning trio from Ennis, County Clare, Ireland\u2014the mecca of Irish traditional music\u2014was formed in 2014.

In 2022, the bands returned with \\'Freakout/Release\\' a collection of flesh-&amp;-blood songs that find the bands reaching into the darkness to emerge as a true creative unit, their gazes fixed positively on the future ahead. 2024 has seen the band lean further into their DJ credentials \u2014 touring worldwide with a Summer packed with festivals including an iconic Glastonbury peak-time set at the all-new Arcadia \u2013 evidence that the band\\'s not even close to slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/46927ded-7db5-4fed-8140-4daba4e5d63e.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/felix-martin-hot-chip-dj-set-with-recess-juliette-165159","startDate":"2026-02-27T04:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-02-27T10:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/felix-martin-hot-chip-dj-set-with-recess-juliette-165159","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":25,"validFrom":"2025-11-12T00:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-02-26T08:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"ROMARE (DJ Set) with Manatee Commune","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;2.27 Friday (Electronica)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall &amp; Solid Sound present:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROMARE (DJ Set)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with Manatee Commune&lt;br /&gt;8pm, 21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;strong&gt;Romare&lt;/strong&gt;, Archie Fairhurst\u2019s working practice is rooted in collage, building vivid new forms out of existing material.

But as a young band, the expectations that went along with a large audience proved daunting. \u201cWe felt a lot of pressure to make something uniquely us, because we had such a big following, and we felt that they deserved more than what we had given them as of yet.\u201d explains the band. The group dug deep into their own musicality, and tried to block out the noise for their sophomore release All That Will (release date: Oct 4, 2024). \u201cIt turned out that dropping those self-imposed expectations and just writing/making music for our own enjoyment was the key to finding our collective voice and making a record we are all proud of.\u201d&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadowgrass began in 2014 when Clay Russell (Banjo), Luke Morris (Mandolin), Kyser George (Guitar) were jamming at the Grayson County Fiddler\u2019s Convention in Elk Creek, VA. Sometime before their first real show, the name Shadowgrass was suggested simply because they thought it sounded \u201ccool\u201d. Kyser, Clay, and Luke were 9, 13, and 14 years old at the time. Now in their early twenties, their influences and listening habits have changed drastically, but the group has always grown in the same direction musically. They have welcomed fiddle player Madison Morris, who also lends vocals and songwriting prowess, and bass player Evan Campfield. Luke and Madison trade off lead vocals, and harmonies seamlessly with one another. Their commitment to and keen interest in songwriting brings additional dimensions to the band, allowing the group to appeal to listeners outside of the expected jam-band community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a very young band that has already been playing together for a decade, Shadowgrass has a unique bond. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up together and have watched each other evolve into the people we are today\u201d, they say. \u201cIt sounds cliche but we definitely act more like siblings than bandmates\u201d. On All That Will, the group explores themes of anxiety and uncertainty, and questioning the people they want to become.

Alix released his debut album &#034;1984&#034; to critical acclaim in 2009 which is still talked about now as one of the most accomplished Drum and Bass albums of all time. Fast forward to 2025, his record label 1985 Music stands as one of the most forward thinking platforms in electronic music, host to a number of ground breaking artists and revered releases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alix has worked with some of the foremost names in dance and electronic music including; Noisia, Foreign Beggars, MachineDrum and many more. Following the release of his 2nd album Chroma Chords in 2013, he delivered a BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix, which was shortlisted for essential mix of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2016 Alix launched his own imprint; 1985 Music. Now in its 9th year since inception, the label is regarded as one of the most tasteful audio &amp; visual platforms in the electronic realm. Always pushing the envelope, the imprint has released music from artists such as MachineDrum, Eprom, SHADES, Calibre, Ivy Lab, Halogenix, Skeptical, along with building a roster of established artists such as Monty, Visages, Cesco, Trail, SubMarine (amongst many others). 1985 Music promotes multiple club nights globally. Highlights include festival stages at Outlook and Shambhala, Untz Festival &amp; Basscoast. Almost every release on the label has found its way to number 1 in the Beatport charts. In 2017 the label won \u2018Best New Label\u2019 at the Drum and Bass Arena Awards (by public vote) and in 2021 it went on to win \u2018Best Dubstep Label\u2019 at the Dubstep Awards (also by public vote).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2015 whilst on a trip to LA, Alix first collaborated with Portland based artist EPROM and later formed their audio visual project SHADES. They have since released multiple EPs &#043; 2 full length albums. Their Sophomore LP has gone onto critical acclaim and found its home on 1985 Music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a duo they have toured globally and continue to receive much praise across the music industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alix\u2019s high levels of creativity and discipline are the reason he is very much at the forefront of&lt;br /&gt;electronic music today.

His sound is defined by personal lyrics, warm vocals, and dynamic production, combining intimate storytelling with modern, expansive arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up as the youngest of four in a musical household, Steinza was first inspired by his father\u2019s drumming and his sister\u2019s guitar playing. After teaching himself guitar and production, he moved from Virginia to Nashville to further develop his sound and find his own voice as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since releasing his debut single \u201cCherokee\u201d in 2018, Steinza has steadily built a dedicated audience and millions of streams. He\u2019s collaborated with artists like Matt Maeson, Paris Jackson, and Sophie Holohan, and his influences range from Noah Kahan and Dominic Fike to Bon Iver and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On stage, Steinza has opened for acts including Shaboozey, Saint Motel, Matt Maeson, Mat Kearney, Joe P, Sam Nelson of X Ambassadors, Zach Seabaugh, and beyond. His live shows balance raw emotion with energy, creating a personal connection with his audience. As his career grows, Steinza continues to focus on writing honest, emotionally driven music and carving out his own space in the folk and indie landscape.&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/b8b72904-f90c-4672-8fd8-c765aa7fe81c.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/steinza-steinza-was-here-tour-with-hudson-ingram-162237","startDate":"2026-03-24T02:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-03-24T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Hidden Hall","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/steinza-steinza-was-here-tour-with-hudson-ingram-162237","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":22.5,"validFrom":"2025-12-03T16:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-03-23T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Mo\\' Jam Mondays","description":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.23 Monday (Mo\\' Jam)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nectar Lounge, KZ Media, Davy Nefos, Morgan Gilkeson and Mo\\' Jam Presents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mo\\' Jam Mondays\u00a0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No Cover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:30pm doors and jam sign-up / 8pm jam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21&#043;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nectar Lounge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;412 N 36th St&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;www.nectarlounge.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit our new website at mojampresents.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cover, donations requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7:30pm: Sign-ups.

Prior to its release, KO hit the road with Pepper and Less Than Jake, which helped the album climb the Billboard Reggae Charts. Since then, Kash\u2019d Out has been no stranger to the open road.

After some early releases during his teenage years, he began to gain traction with 2017\u2019s full-length Is Everything Okay in Your World? Switching locales to Los Angeles, his follow-up, A Day in a Yellow Beat, appeared in 2020. Two years later, the pandemic-inspired EP trilogy Slow Dance &amp; Romance, Apple Pie, and Inner Peace was steeped in psychedelic soul.&lt;br /&gt;Born in Manchester, England, and raised in Haselmere, van den Broek\u2019s musical endeavors began when he got a guitar for Christmas at the age of 11. With influences that include Ray Charles, Mac DeMarco, and Thundercat, he started releasing stand-alone singles as a teen in late 2015. His debut EP, Harmless Melodies, arrived in November 2016. Yellow Days continued to release periodic singles in 2017, some of which appeared on his debut LP, Is Everything Okay in Your World?, that October. It featured a guest spot by hip-hop artist Rejjie Snow. Early the next year, \u201cGap in the Clouds,\u201d from his first EP, reached a broader audience when it accompanied the trailer for the second season of Donald Glover\u2019s show Atlanta. Yellow Days followed up in April 2018 with the single \u201cThe Way Things Change\u201d and a week\u2019s worth of club shows in the U.S. that quickly sold out, before continuing the tour in Europe. The musician\u2019s sophomore effort arrived in 2020: titled A Day in a Yellow Beat, the project was written and recorded primarily in L.A., with van den Broek sourcing new inspiration from local collaborators.&lt;br /&gt;Yellow Days\u2019 next undertaking was a set of three self-produced EPs released throughout 2022 and consisting of a combined 17 songs. Slow Dance &amp; Romance began the series in April, with Apple Pie following in July, and Inner Peace closing out the project in September. Conceived and recorded during the early part of the COVID-19 pandemic, they were said to represent a catalog of his \u201cmindset in lockdown.\u201d ~ Marcy Donelson&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/e98cc7d7-b5e3-4496-bfa6-a429d49db77c.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/yellow-days-with-guests-162745","startDate":"2026-04-03T02:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-04-03T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/yellow-days-with-guests-162745","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":30,"validFrom":"2025-11-19T18:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-04-02T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Hockey Teeth w/ Poached, Zailee Haze","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;4.2.26 Thursday Indie/Rock/Alternative)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall Presents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hockey Teeth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;w/ Poached, Zailee Haze&lt;br /&gt;7:30PM doors&lt;br /&gt;8:00PM show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hockey Teeth&lt;/strong&gt; is like every band you\\'ve ever heard before, just better and with catchier songs.

He bends the organ to his will like a true mastercraftsman. He\u2019s a veteran of the soul revival scene, having played on many Daptone recording sessions since their inception, but also has learned from some of the legends of soul jazz: Melvin Sparks and The Turbanator himself Dr. Lonnie Smith. Jimmy James needs no introduction to many as he\u2019s been seen all over the world performing with instrumental groups The True Loves and the Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio. Perhaps the most dangerous right hand in all of soul music, his signature funky approach can be identified by even the most novice of music fans, a feat most musicians could only dream of. Tim Carman. The backbone. The pocket. Having cut his teeth touring the world with blues group GA-20, Carman\u2019s expertise in the world of blues shuffles might make him an unlikely candidate to lay the foundation for the funky Parlor Greens, but this debut LP shows otherwise. Steady, heavy pockets and as funky as they come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parlor Greens started off as an idea before it even had a name. Carman had been chatting with Colemine label boss Terry Cole about their shared love for organ combo records of yesterday on labels like Blue Note and Prestige. Cole said he\u2019d love to have an organ trio be the first project at the label\u2019s new studio, Portage Lounge, located in Loveland, Ohio. So when Carman tapped James and Scone for the session, the stage was set. Carman and Cole had started work a day early to dial in the drum sound, so when the rest of this murderer\u2019s row arrived they hit the ground running. It was instant chemistry. Within the first ten minutes of everyone plugging in, a song was written and recorded, \u201cWest Memphis\u201d. And over the next three days, these three maestros conducted a beautiful and soulful symphony straight to tape. As natural and fun as three old friends getting together after a long absence, only this was the first time they had written and performed together. True magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is the result of that session. Eleven cuts. Ten originals. Two sides. All killer, no filler. Straight to the old reliable Tascam 388 tape machine, mixed up nice and dirty for your enjoyment. Parlor Greens are proud to present their debut long player, In Green / We Dream.&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/7d02b14c-d8ec-46ca-b75b-489d4ba18a3a.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/parlor-greens-with-guests-annie-j-full-band--161566","startDate":"2026-04-04T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-04-04T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Hidden Hall","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/parlor-greens-with-guests-annie-j-full-band--161566","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":25,"validFrom":"2025-10-23T17:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-04-03T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"PREMO RICE with Jesse Desean &amp; DJ Indica Jones","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;4.3 Friday (Hip-Hop)&lt;br /&gt;Nectar &amp; Solid Sound present:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREMO RICE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with Jesse Desean&lt;br /&gt;&amp; DJ Indica Jones&lt;br /&gt;8pm, 21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;Nectar Lounge&lt;br /&gt;412 N 36th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nectarlounge.com&quot;&gt;www.nectarlounge.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premo Rice&lt;/strong&gt; also known as Mr. Rice and The Bishop is a rapper from Prince George\\'s County, Maryland who creates the perfect blend of funk, soul, and hip hop, into his music.

They certainly infuse those genres into the mix. More than anything though, this is an unabashed cosmic rock band intent on taking audiences into an alternate dimension of pure freedom and dance euphoria where the outside world ceases to exist. Their three-part vocal harmonies carry major impact with intoxicating doses of soul, blues and sultry appeal. The passionate musicianship and group synergy resonates in their pure sense of joy.

But he was quickly being tasked &#043; hired to tackle projects for other artists / small labels.\u00a0This forced him to learn the ins and outs of the industry on the business side as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\u00a0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\u00a0&lt;/div&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/bb33631b-3c64-4c23-90c8-174231da9ab2.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/dylan-reese-x-adam-yokum-w-emanuel-brown-sean-patek-173712","startDate":"2026-04-13T02:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-04-13T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Hidden Hall","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/hiddenhall/events/dylan-reese-x-adam-yokum-w-emanuel-brown-sean-patek-173712","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":17,"validFrom":"2026-01-27T18:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-04-12T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"DAMAG3 w/ Amber Ryan","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;4.12.26 Sunday (Hip Hop/Alternative/Pop)&lt;br /&gt;Nectar Presents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAMAG3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;w/ Amber Ryann&lt;br /&gt;7:00PM Doors&lt;br /&gt;8:00PM Show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;Nectar Lounge&lt;br /&gt;412 N 36th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nectarlounge.com&quot;&gt;www.nectarlounge.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praised by Doechii, Danny Brown, and millions of folks around the world, &lt;strong&gt;DAMAG3 &lt;/strong&gt;transcends the stigma and limitations transgender women face in the music industry with her independent, self-managed success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widely loved &amp; narrowly hated for her unfiltered and direct lyrics, DAMAG3 has built her fanbase\u2013ironically rather quickly\u2013with her \u201cone fan at a time\u201d approach.

The universe, however, had other plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#034;I intended to see as much of the world as I could and get inspired to write an authentic body of music.

Known for live shows that incorporate a loose, improvisatory jam band feel, the group garnered some renown in the Northeast U.S. live music circuit throughout the 2000s. 10 Ft. Ganja Plant debuted in 2000 with the independently released Presents, a more dub-flavored, instrumental affair than anything released by their parent group. ROIR, no stranger to classic dub and reggae, signed the band in 2001, releasing their follow-up, Hillside Airstrip.

Pitchfork summed it up thusly: \u201cBlack Up is drowned in murky instrumentals and bombastic, introspective rhymes. The sounds flirt with jazz but also root themselves in a firm understanding of silence, or the sparse magic of simplicity. The songs teem with unexpected climaxes...From great mystery exploded an album of impossible vision.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That \u201cimpossible vision\u201d has continued to confound and engage Shabazz Palaces fans over the course of four acclaimed albums and two EPs. Each release feels like an evolution, letting the music speak for itself, while slowly revealing more about its creator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With The Don of Diamond Dreams, that spirit remains, this time embracing modernism in hip-hop and rap. The album features the highlights \u201cFast Learner (ft. Purple Tape Nate),\u201d \u201cChocolate Souffle,\u201d \u201cBad Bitch Walking (ft. Stas THEE Boss), and \u201cThanking The Girls.\u201d It also features contributions from singer/keyboardist Darrius Willrich, Seattle\u2019s OCnotes (who collaborated with Ishmael Butler on the Knife Knights project), Los Angeles musician Carlos Overall, and bassist Evan Flory-Barnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Don of Diamond Dreams was produced by Shabazz Palaces at Protect and Exalt: A Black Space in Seattle, mixed and engineered by Erik Blood at Studio 4 Labs in Venice, California, and mastered by Scott Sedillo at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/6e884cec-c2da-46dd-aa36-106311abea97.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/shabazz-palaces-plus-stas-thee-boss-and-jusmoni-174624","startDate":"2026-04-26T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-04-26T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/shabazz-palaces-plus-stas-thee-boss-and-jusmoni-174624","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":30,"validFrom":"2026-01-26T23:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-04-25T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"EL TEN ELEVEN","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;4.29 Wednesday (Electro Psychedelic Rock)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall &amp; The PBJ Present:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EL TEN ELEVEN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7pm doors&lt;br /&gt;8pm show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We like to believe our lives can be shaped into stories\u2014clean arcs, legible meaning\u2014but liferefuses the outline. Instead, it moves bluntly and without apology, indifferent to our sense of order. Events pile up without resolution, momentum divorced from direction, motion confused for progress.

Across eight tracks, it considers not just nothingness but velocity\u2014the strange urgency that propels us forward even when the destination remains unclear. We are committed to acceleration, convinced speed itself might save us. The 33-minute album slows just long enough to pose the harder questions: what are we running from, and what do we think we can outrun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That tension appears even in the album\u2019s artwork, once again created with longtime collaborator Rob Fleming. It depicts a classic liminal space: familiar, anonymous, quietly unsettling.

He\u02bbll be bringing the sunshine and island vibes back to Seattle for one night only, where he is working on an album at the famous London Bridge Studios in Seattle. Tavana is a one-man musical wrecking crew from Honolulu, who uses his feet to lay down a variety of grooves while simultaneously playing guitar, banjo, dobro, or ukulele and singing deep-soulful, island-inspired rock and blues, bridging the gap between Hawaiian Music and Delta Blues. He consistently sells shows out in Hawaii leaving audiences in awe of his musical energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cHe\u2019s more the exception than the rule, he is a great human and I\u2019m glad to know him\u201d \u2014Eddie Vedder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\u201cTavana is a man on a mission and big opportunities await his arrival.

I believe he\u2019s on the edge of going big.\u201d \u2014 Henry Kapono&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavana is known for his Waikiki jam sessions and regularly jams with a who\u2019s who of players in Hawaii, including Eddie Vedder who invited Tavana to sing \u2018Hawaii 78\u2019 - a Hawaii anthem of sorts - with him at the Hawaii Theatre. From a recording of their performance together, Vedder produced a limited vinyl record that was sent out to 10,000 Pearl Jam fans. Vedder also took Tavana out on tour for several dates as his opening act for his solo album. Tavana has jammed with many musical greats, including Jack Johnson, Pat Simmons, Michael McDonald, Henry Kapono, G Love, Willie K, John Cruz, Ron and Thunderstorm Artis, and Leon Mobley (Ben Harper &amp; The Innocent Criminals). He also has been the supporting act for Alabama Shakes, Shakey Graves, Xavier Rudd, Jenny Lewis, Julian Marley, and Kaleo to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tavana is a multi-N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano (Hawaiian Grammy\u00ae) nominee and is currently featured on an in-flight video on all Hawaiian Airlines.

Phonetically named after the mythological Titan who held up the heavens, Atlus wrote his first two (of four) albums while working as a commercial driver behind the wheel of semi-trucks, using the long, lonesome miles of highway to craft lyrics and workshop melodies as he drove countless hours to help support his family and fund studio time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pavement-pounding lifestyle became both his education and his engine. Over time, it helped grow his underground following and ultimately led to breakout moments like performing alongside Jelly Roll at a packed Red Rocks Amphitheatre in his home state, and landing a Top 5 album on Spotify\u2019s Global Album Chart, along with a Platinum single. The magic of Atlus lies in how he marries candid, arresting, and often dark subjects with a kaleidoscope of sound. His music blends multiple styles into something fresh and immersive, anchored by storytelling that creates a deep connection with fans. Now with over a billion on-demand streams and two million followers across socials, Atlus continues to build his career on real connection and resilience. He\u2019s holding up his musical dreams in support of his family and anyone who turns to music as an outlet for their own struggles.

His cool, precise flow and intricate, literate rhymes weren\\'t as theatrical as Method Man or Ol\\' Dirty Bastard, the two biggest commercial stars to spring from the collective. But among hip-hop aficionados, GZA was revered for his flawless technique and lyrical dexterity, and was considered by many to be the best pure rapper in the entire Clan. GZA was born Gary Grice on August 22, 1966, on Staten Island, New York, and shuttled between several other New York boroughs with various relatives during his childhood. He started learning rhymes by the earliest hip-hop MCs while spending time in the Bronx, and returned to Staten Island to share them with his cousins, who later became known as Ol\\' Dirty Bastard and the RZA. In fact, the three of them first teamed up in the early \\'80s as part of an obscure group called All in Together Now.&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/0305c88a-6b25-4752-b1a9-f88a353a9946.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/-rescheduled-gza-featuring-phunky-nomads-plus-greg-cypher-dj-indica-jones-160958","startDate":"2026-05-14T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-05-14T07:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/-rescheduled-gza-featuring-phunky-nomads-plus-greg-cypher-dj-indica-jones-160958","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":45,"validFrom":"2025-10-10T17:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-05-13T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Nogu Svelo!","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;5.14 Thursday (Rock)&lt;br /&gt;Roots &amp; Chords Music presents: &lt;strong&gt;NOGU SVELO!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a 21&#043; event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Timing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doors \u2013 6:30 PM (VIP &amp; Meet &amp; Greet ticket holders only)&lt;br /&gt;Doors \u2013 7:00 PM (General Admission)&lt;br /&gt;Show \u2013 7:30 PM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIP &amp; Meet &amp; Greet Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes early entry at 6:30 PM, priority access to seating/viewing areas (no reserved seating), and a\u00a0&lt;strong&gt;post-show Meet &amp; Greet with Nogu Svelo!&lt;/strong&gt;\u00a0including photo opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please note: the Meet &amp; Greet takes place after the performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Edition LP Pre-Order \u2013 $100&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusive pre-order of the upcoming LP, available for pickup at the merch table on the night of the show.

He began experimenting with cutting edge sounds and technologies, incorporating exotic live instruments and vocals into his productions. This fusion of organic and electronic elements became a hallmark of Rab\u2019s sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARDALAN&lt;br /&gt;Born in Tehran, Ardalan found himself gravitating towards an unlikely passion for music at anearly age. Enamored first by traditional Iranian music and classic jazz and rock, Ardalan\u2019s taste began to transform with his childhood years spent moving back and forth from Iran andCalifornia. With each intercontinental return, Ardalan grew his treasure trove of mixtapes filledwith rare musical gems like gangsta rap, Italo disco, and movie and video game soundtracks\u2013the best of the West.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, when he permanently returned toCalifornia in 2006, his distinct taste in music drew him towards long-lasting friendships, which were born through exchanges of mixtape gold and out seeking underground excursions. Ardalan became a regular of the underground scene inthe Bay Area, absorbing the sounds of house and techno from the likes of Solar and Galen atthe legendary Sunset Sound System parties, and it wasn\u2019t long before he was hooked. Full of his signature charm, spark of energy, and an insatiable curiosity for left-of-center music, soonhe found his way to a fateful BBQ in San Francisco, a legendary party that is largely known asthe origin story lore of the Dirtybird crew. Immediately, the crew took to young Ardy like family. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came \u201cMr. Spock.\u201d Call it beginner\u2019s luck, or more likely, a sign of what was to come\u2013in 2010, Ardalan shared one of his earliest studio explorations with Justin Martin, which became the foundation for the breakout hit. \u201cMr. Spock,\u201d in its bizarre and booty-shaking glory, has been accredited as one of the \u201ctracks that made Dirtybird famous,\u201d helping to define the label\u2019s now darling reputation as a trusted source of ridiculous, off-the-wall dance floor bangers. Since, he\u2019s continued to translate his deep-rooted connection to the dance floor in the studio with remixes on Toy Tonics, Play It Down, Yoshitoshi, and Dirtybird. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade later, Ardy is a favored act on line-ups who trust in his ability to fire up a crowd withhis DJ prowess and ability to make eclectic selections feel right at home on the dancefloor. He\u2019s played at Coachella, Dirtybird Campout, CRSSD, Secret Garden, Desert Hearts and at esteemed venues like Space Miami, New York\u2019s Output, and Detroit\u2019s TV Lounge. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, Ardalan sets his sights on defining his own sound in the studio with the release of hisdebut album ,Mr. Good. He\u2019s set out to push his reputation as a musical chameleon to the limits with his record; a powerful melding of tough, jarring beats with lush melodies. Equally rowdy as it is introspective, it\u2019s safe to say that like Ardalan himself, there\u2019s nothing out there like Mr.Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/5c25b4c1-4e6e-4854-bbc5-5ae3baec445e.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/random-rab-ardalan-plus-michael-manahan-jamie-schwabl-173242","startDate":"2026-05-24T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-05-24T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/random-rab-ardalan-plus-michael-manahan-jamie-schwabl-173242","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":22.5,"validFrom":"2026-01-19T19:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-05-23T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"DOCTORFUNK (2 sets)","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;5.24 Sunday (Funk)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall &amp; The PBJ Present:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#034;an evening with&#034;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOCTORFUNK (2 sets)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;DoctorFunk 30th Anniversary Tour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7pm doors&lt;br /&gt;8pm show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Northwest United States, a region long known for producing energetic and fresh musical talent, blazes the Emerald City\\'s latest sensation.

His early-\\'80s success brought the popularity of toasting -- the reggae equivalent of rapping -- to a whole new level, and helped establish dancehall as the wave of the future. For better or for worse, he also epitomized dancehall\\'s penchant for &#034;slack&#034; lyrics -- that is, casual violence, sexism, homophobia, and general rudeness. Graphic sexuality was his particular forte, reaching levels of explicitness previously unheard in Jamaica. It brought him numerous detractors, but it was also a big reason for his early popularity. There was more to it than that, though; Yellowman was one of the most verbally nimble toasters of his time, with a loose, easy flow, a talent for improvisation, and a definite wit in his wordplay. Plus, all the boasting about his prowess on the mic or in the bedroom had to be over the top to be convincing: true to his stage name, Yellowman is an albino, which carries a tremendous social stigma in Jamaica. His rise to stardom was unlikely enough, but his transformation from untouchable outcast into sex symbol was staggering -- and may not even have taken place without his trademark lewdness. Shocking though it could be, it affirmed him as a sexual being just like his listeners, and was delivered with enough humor to let the audience know that he didn\\'t take himself too seriously. Bouts with cancer pushed him into more thoughtful, socially conscious territory in the 1990s, but his initial style remains the most influential, paving the way for countless dancehall toasters to follow. He remained quiet through most of the 2000s before mounting a comeback with 2019\\'s No More War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellowman was born Winston Foster in Negril, Jamaica, in 1959 (some accounts say 1956). An early target for abuse because of his albinism, he grew up in an institution in Kingston, with little to keep him company besides music. Influenced by early toasting DJs like U-Roy, he practiced rhyming and got a job with the Gemini Sound System as a substitute DJ. Christening himself Yellowman and dressing in a bright yellow suit, he peppered his lyrics with jokes about his skin color and outlandish tales of his sexual conquests. In 1979, he won a landslide victory at the well-known Tastee Talent Contest, and within months he had become one of Jamaica\\'s top concert draws, thanks to a dynamic, humorous stage show in which he often used the microphone to mimic his anatomical gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellowman recorded prolifically in the early \\'80s, at one point flooding the Jamaican market with more than 40 singles. His first full-length album, Them a Mad Over Me, was recorded for Channel One in 1981 and featured the hit title track and the single &#034;Me Kill Barnie,&#034; an answer record to Lone Ranger\\'s hit &#034;Barnabas Collins.&#034; He also scored with singles like &#034;Operation Eradication&#034; and the infamously slack &#034;Shorties,&#034; which Peter Tosh condemned as degrading to women (hardly the first time such a criticism would be leveled at him). Despite this success, Yellowman didn\\'t truly hit his stride on record until he hooked up with groundbreaking dancehall producer Henry &#034;Junjo&#034; Lawes. The 1982 LP Mister Yellowman kicked off their collaboration; released internationally by Greensleeves, it started to break him in the U.K. and U.S., and is still often acclaimed as his best album. It also launched a series of Jamaican hit singles over the next few years that included &#034;Yellowman Getting Married&#034; (a rewrite of the My Fair Lady number &#034;I\\'m Getting Married in the Morning&#034;), &#034;Mr. Chin,&#034; &#034;Who Can Make the Dance Ram&#034; (a rewrite of &#034;The Candy Man&#034;), &#034;Zungguzungguguzungguzeng&#034; (sampled by several hip-hop acts), &#034;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,&#034; &#034;Soldier Take Over,&#034; &#034;Nobody Move Nobody Get Hurt,&#034; and &#034;Wreck a Pum Pum,&#034; among others. Many of his recordings during this era featured vocal contributions from fellow DJ/toaster Fathead, whose specialty was punctuating lines with animal noises (&#034;ribbit&#034; and &#034;oink&#034; were his favorites).&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/a5ee278d-155a-483d-81c7-b20af142ce20.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/yellowman-with-the-highlife-band-and-dj-kid-hops-kexp--172976","startDate":"2026-05-29T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-05-29T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/yellowman-with-the-highlife-band-and-dj-kid-hops-kexp--172976","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":25,"validFrom":"2026-01-16T20:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-05-28T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"THE LOVECATS &amp; COOOL BABIES","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;5.29 Friday (The Cure / Talking Heads)&lt;br /&gt;Hidden Hall presents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE LOVECATS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COOOL BABIES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8pm doors&lt;br /&gt;8:45pm show&lt;br /&gt;21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hidden Hall&lt;br /&gt;400 N 35th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hiddenhall.com&quot;&gt;hiddenhall.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formed in 2017, &lt;strong&gt;The Lovecats&lt;/strong&gt; showcase the emotion, look, and sound of an album quality authentic early-era Cure performance.

Avalon\u2019s back-story begins on the streets of Hollywood, California. Raised by his heroin-addicted father, he began selling pot at a young age, a trade he acquired from his mother. In an attempt to clean up his act, Mickey converted to Orthodox Judaism in his late teens, an effort that didn\u2019t last due to constant family tragedy, such as his father\u2019s death in a tragic drunk driving accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By his early 20s, Mickey had married, had a daughter, and moved out of California, relocating to Portland, Oregon. The serine surroundings of the Pacific Northwest couldn\u2019t hide Mickey from his past for long, as his drug addled Hollywood lifestyle caught up with him in the form of an uncontrollable heroin addiction. As his life neared rock bottom, Mickey found himself broke, divorced, and turning to prostitution, just to support his smack habit. With a desire to once again get his life back on track, Avalon moved in with his sister, and the pair set out on the road to recovery. Tragedy struck again when his sister relapsed, and died from a heroin overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the deaths of both his father and sister, Mickey decided that he wanted more out of life, moved back to Los Angeles, and chose to make one final attempt to clean up his act. Shortly after his return, Mickey was befriended by ex-MTV VJ Simon Rex (aka Dirt Nasty), who encouraged Avalon to pursue his passion of hip-hop and even collaborated with him on some tracks. At the time, Avalon was staying in a sober living facility and had a strict curfew, so Dirt Nasty began passing out Mickey\u2019s demo at Hollywood clubs, which helped Mickey develop a following among fans of the Los Angeles nightclub scene.&lt;br /&gt;As Mickey\u2019s popularity grew, he began to sell out clubs throughout California with his legendary live show. Soon after Interscope Records took notice of the guerilla promotions tactics and signed Avalon to the label in 2005. Through Interscope, Avalon released his now classic self-titled debut album, which showcased his unique rhyming style and indulgent lyrics. Inspired by his experiences on the streets with drugs and prostitution, the raw honesty of his songs immediately resonated with audiences. Fan&lt;br /&gt;favorites \u201cJane Fonda,\u201d \u201cMr. Right\u201d and \u201cMy Dick\u201d quickly spread across the internet and mainstream radio, turning Mickey Avalon into a household name. Avalon quickly took to the road and was performing sold-out shows alongside the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Travis Barker and DJ AM, Snoop Dogg, Stephen Marley and Slightly Stoopid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mickey\u2019s contagious demeanor and unique writing style has made him a hot commodity in the music industry as hip-hop artist Young Jeezy and producer Jermaine Dupri jumped at the chance to collaborate with him for a Boost Mobile commercial. Avalon then joined forces with rock acts the Happy Mondays, and Unwritten Law, with whom he co-wrote the radio hit \u201cShoulda Known Better\u201d. His music has been featured in countless movies and television series including the HBO\u2019s series Hung, the animated series American Dad, the Duke Nukem Forever video game, Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay and most recently in the trailers for the Cameron Diaz film \u201cBad Teacher.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/599ff706-0ff6-49fb-bcc7-e894f981324d.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/mickey-avalon-20th-anniversary-plus-ayo-dot-the-uppercuts-ryan-van-hygan-mc-type-dj-indica-jones-173255","startDate":"2026-06-06T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-06-06T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/mickey-avalon-20th-anniversary-plus-ayo-dot-the-uppercuts-ryan-van-hygan-mc-type-dj-indica-jones-173255","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":28,"validFrom":"2026-01-19T20:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-06-05T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"MACHINEDRUM_-_BL0000MS_TOUR","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;6.12 Friday (Electronica)&lt;br /&gt;Nectar presents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MACHINEDRUM_-_BL0000MS_TOUR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;AN_INTIMATE_3_&#043;_HOUR_DJ_SET&lt;br /&gt;8pm, 21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;Nectar Lounge&lt;br /&gt;412 N 36th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nectarlounge.com&quot;&gt;www.nectarlounge.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BL0000MS (Blooms) is a new Machinedrum club show: a 3 hour DJ set built around my upcoming dancefloor-ready EP \u201cS33DS&#034;.

A pioneer and a populariser, a restless and relentless seeker, Stewart brings together coasts and continents in projects which are both conceptual and heartfelt, clever and banging. He has produced and composed over a dozen albums under various aliases since his first independent release in 1999. Covering an astonishing variety of styles with ease, through solo Machinedrum work and with collaborative projects Sepalcure, JETS, Dream Continuum, or other mutations, Stewart has established himself as electronic music\u2019s true Renaissance man. His debut as Machinedrum, Now You Know, was released in 2001 on pioneering Miami-based Merck Records and gained worldwide attention and praise from musicians, fans and critics. Having a strong background in both acoustic and electronic instrumentation, he was quickly able to navigate those various elements on his early releases, from field recording and vintage synth-laden Urban Biology to his seminal production and mixing of This Charming Mixtape with MC Theophilus London and his critically acclaimed 2009 album Want To 1 2?&lt;/p&gt;","image":"https://static.tixr.com/static/images/external/img/ebaadeb9-b28d-48aa-aa4e-4226f44412ce.jpg","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/machinedrum-bl0000ms-tour-176751","startDate":"2026-06-13T03:00:00+00:00","endDate":"2026-06-13T09:00:00+00:00","location":{"@type":"Place","name":"Nectar Lounge","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"","addressLocality":"Seattle","addressRegion":"WA","addressCountry":"US"}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","url":"https://www.tixr.com/groups/nectarlounge/events/machinedrum-bl0000ms-tour-176751","category":"primary","availability":"InStock","priceCurrency":"USD","price":30,"validFrom":"2026-02-11T23:00:00+00:00","validThrough":"2026-06-12T07:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"ANDRE NICKATINA with Special Guests","description":"&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;6.19 Friday (Hip-Hop)&lt;br /&gt;Nectar &amp; Solid Sound present:&lt;br /&gt;ANDRE NICKATINA\u00a0&lt;br /&gt;with Special Guests&lt;br /&gt;8pm, 21&#043;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;Nectar Lounge&lt;br /&gt;412 N 36th St&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nectarlounge.com&quot;&gt;www.nectarlounge.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;font-weight:400&quot;&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a penchant for old-school rhymes and lo-fi beats, &lt;strong&gt;Andre Nickatina&lt;/strong&gt; hails from the West Coast.
