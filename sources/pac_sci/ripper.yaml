# DISABLED: WordPress API only provides publication dates, not actual event dates
# The API returns events with publication dates (e.g., Dec 8) instead of actual event dates (e.g., Dec 17)
# This causes all events to appear in the past or have incorrect dates
# Would need proper event calendar plugin with structured date fields to work correctly
