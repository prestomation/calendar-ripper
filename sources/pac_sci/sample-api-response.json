Naomi is known for running hit nerd-themed comedy shows across the West Coast and for creating Jon the Robot, a stand-up comic featured in TIME Magazine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening the night is Jenna Nobs, a librarian-turned-comedian whose clever, language-loving humor explores everything from education to Smash Mouth. Jenna has performed at Bumbershoot and the Wet City Comedy Festival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three comedians. One brilliantly nerdy night of laughs. Don\u2019t miss it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tickets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>General: $25<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Members: $20<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About the Performers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Hagen<\/strong>, headliner of the show, is a mostly normal person with an irritating obsession with mathematics. In an act of wild desperation, she began moonlighting as a stand-up comedian with the express purpose of incorporating mathematics into comedy. Seven years later, she is a fixture of the northwest comedy scene and co-producer of the touring STEM vaudeville show Singu-hilarity, as well as the popular recurring show Naughty but Nerdy, which runs all over the West Coast. She holds a PhD in mathematics and is a former OMSI Science Communication Fellow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Naomi Fitter<\/strong>, producer of the show, escaped from Ohio at the age of 22. Her soothing midwestern voice has been described as &#8220;sexy,&#8221; &#8220;librarian-like,&#8221; and &#8220;nearly inaudible.&#8221; She has opened for Aparna Nancherla, Laurie Kilmartin, and Whitney Cummings and performed in the All Jane Comedy Festival. Naomi runs nerdy comedy shows like Naughty but Nerdy and STEM Cabaret all over the West Coast, and she has been featured on the NPR-distributed show Live Wire with Luke Burbank and the Dork Forest with Jackie Kashian. Her robotic stand-up comedian, Jon the Robot, was featured in TIME Magazine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jenna Nobs<\/strong>, our opening act, is a librarian turned stand-up whose act embodies a playful love of language. Wry but inviting, she explores everything from education and relationships to Smash Mouth. Jenna has opened for Ali Kolbert and performed at Bumbershoot and Wet City Comedy Festival.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Join PacSci for a smart, silly, and delightfully nerdy comedy night featuring three standout performers in PACCAR IMAX Theater.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":853892,"template":"","age_level":[110],"cost":[26],"event_series":[34],"event_type":[],"location":[39],"topic":[],"class_list":["post-765905","event","type-event","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","age_level-adults-18","cost-tickets-required-price-varies","event_series-special-event","location-paccar-theater"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v26.7 -
