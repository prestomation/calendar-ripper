The successor to 2022’s Bajascillators glides easily into frame, but once there, Inland See is deceptively immediate: four songs, entirely within themselves, all together forming an essential whole. Inland See is out September 26; the lead single \"Skylarking\" arrives today with a new visualizer featuring visuals by Nick Ciontea.\n\nWith every successive Bitchin Bajas release, we see that the real key for them is a sense of discovery, that tingle that comes when you feel something breaking through. The sky opening up. Take \"Skylarking\": a remarkable construction, built to and fro in the ether, but with a deceptive grasp of four-on-the-floor rhythm. A space dance that achieves completion in almost aggressive terms — aggressive like an oxygen bath! — showcasing jewels from their world music and jazz archives, then returning to their undulous source drone, riding smoothly back into silence. The stuff that fills this Inland See holds you up powerfully, as if you’re floating, saltwater or helium-wise — effervescent, effortless, elemental.\n\nThis music was mostly written on the road. It’s an unusual happening for Bitchin Bajas! They were open for it, though — the landmarked Bajascillators kept them out there for a while, and when inspiration struck, there they're rolling. When it was time to render it to tape and find the record there, they did the whole thing at Electrical Audio, recorded in Studio B by Cooper. Recording all together in the room there lent a sense of space, which they dug and captured as natural as possible. No reverb at all added after the fact. Some additional recording and mixing was done at home by the Bajas, then Phil Baljeu did up the art.

fees)**\n\n**Day of: $25 ($33.48 after fees)**\n\n**The Thing:**\n\nWhat is The Thing? It’s a New York band, sure, but it’s also an ethos. A return to rock & roll’s roots — to garage bands toiling between the family minivans, to groups like the Beatles and their unique alchemy, to tape machines and live band recordings instead of slick studios and myriad songwriters. “We've kind of adapted the ethos of: with restriction comes creativity — old becomes new. And throughout every part of the process that remains true,” says guitarist/vocalist Jack Bradley.\n\nNever is that more apparent than on their self-titled third record, out August 6th on their own label. A rough and tumble suite of 12 songs that nods to everyone from The Kinks to The White Stripes, The Thing sounds like old New York revivicated and remixed. “It showcases all of us, all of our different personalities,” says bassist/vocalist Zane Acord. “In The Thing, we’re a collective band. We hang our hats on being a true band — where we all have the spotlight. I think that gives us a different edge.” That album follows 2023’s debut, Here’s the Thing, and The Things Is, which dropped the following year.\n\nThe four members of Thing came from intersecting backgrounds, lending to their rock-and-roll-as-melting-pot vibe. Acord grew up with a drummer dad who hipped him to bands like Led Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad; he met guitarist/vocals Michael Carter — an avid Beatles fan — in middle school. The duo went on to collect Bradley in high school, an aspiring producer with a studio in his basement and a yen for psych rock. Jazz drummer Lucas Ebeling linked up with the band when everyone found their way to New York in 2022. They’ve since played more than 300 shows across the world.\n\nThe band’s self-titled work, then, is a culmination of all those influences — and all that hustle. “We threw all of our different various influences throughout — all the decades of rock and roll and adjacent genres — and ended up with something of our own,” Bradley says. “Our contribution to the genre.
