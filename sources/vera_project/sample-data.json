Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Vera, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print service location.\n\n2\\.

Some familiarity with Digital Audio Workstations (i.e. ProTools, Logic, Reaper, Ableton, etc.) is encouraged.\n\nAfter taking this course, students who are new to studio recording should be ready for the multi-week Recording Studio Workshop Series, as well as having a better grounding for independent research. Students who are experienced with studio recording may be credentialed for volunteering at studio sessions.\n\nPresented by The Vera Project.\n\nRecommended for ages 14 - 99","external_url":null,"lineup":[{"details":"Doors open","time":"1:00 PM"}],"checksum":"C63F1A1938440C4A4B1905ECC43CEB8B","links":[{"name":"Get Involved at VERA","url":"theveraproject.org/get-involved"}],"tags":["classes"],"presented_by":"Presented by The Vera Project.","show_price_breakdown":false,"genre_tags":["workshop:educational"],"apple_music_tracks":[],"id":"693a06f7b42ee3000170cbee","destination_event_perm_name":null,"hash":"3on6l8","name":"RS 101: Intro to Vera's Recording Studio","spotify_tracks":[],"venue":"The Vera Project","perm_name":"rs-101-intro-to-veras-recording-studio-28th-feb-the-vera-project-seattle-tickets","price":null,"destination_event_id":null,"address":"305 Harrison Street, Seattle, Washington 98109, United States","venues":[{"city":{"code":"Seattle","country_alpha3":"USA","country_id":"5982dffafa1614a04fe33793","country_name":"United States of America","id":"5e3c245c136e51081e406ed1","name":"Seattle"},"id":12011,"name":"The Vera Project","url":"https://dice.fm/venue/the-vera-project-wmmg"}],"type":"event","int_id":535391,"all_ttys_code_locked":false,"date_end":"2026-02-28T23:00:00Z","cities":[{"code":"Seattle","country_alpha3":"USA","country_id":"5982dffafa1614a04fe33793","country_name":"United States of America","id":"5e3c245c136e51081e406ed1","name":"Seattle"}],"sale_end_date":"2026-02-28T21:30:00Z"},{"type_tags":["culture:workshop"],"featured":false,"bundles":[{"id":5206,"name":"Open Sessions","description":"Screen Print Open Sessions at The Vera Project's studio","image":"https://dice-media.imgix.net/attachments/2024-12-16/3f85cbb0-df76-4d59-8985-638f608caa52.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C768%2C768"}],"flags":["qr-code","cooling-off-period","going_ahead"],"age_limit":"This is an All Ages event.

Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator, who can provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen Printing 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessions: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media, T-shirt Press for shirts, tote bags and other fabrics, and Screen prep for just screen preparation.

Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Vera, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print service location.\n\n2\\.

Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Vera, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print service location.\n\n2\\.

Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator, who can provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen Printing 101 class. We offer three different kinds of tickets at Open Sessions: Vacuum Table for paper and other flat media, T-shirt Press for shirts, tote bags and other fabrics, and Screen prep for just screen preparation. Each ticket is limited to two. If the ticket you are looking for is sold out, please add yourself to the waitlist so you can be notified when a ticket becomes available.\n\nFor Open Sessions, Vera provides:\n\n- Rentable screens\n- Emulsion and emulsion remover\n- Squegees\n- Basic tools like spatulas, rulers, tape, etc.\n\nParticipants must provide their own:\n\n- Substrate (paper, t-shirts, etc)\n- Water based ink\n\nVera *does not* allow the use of non-water based inks at our studio, as our studio is not set up to safely process non-water based ink.\n\nIf you have any questions, please email matt@theveraproject.org.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n1\\. Can Vera print a transparent stencil for me?\n\nYes — You must send us your stencil at least 24 hours before the start of your session. Your file must be a .PDF, no larger than 12\" x 18\", and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edits to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Vera, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the SP 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advice on your project, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance, please reach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I really want to use your studio during an Open Session, but there are no slots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand, so we apologize if our Open Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several events every day at Vera, so it can be difficult for us to find more time for Open Sessions.

Your file must be a .PDF, no larger than 12\" x 18\", and ready to print. Vera cannot make any edits to your file. Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Vera, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print service location.\n\n2\\. What if I need direct assistance on my projects?\n\nOur moderators are trained to assist with any topics covered in the SP 101 class offered at Vera. While some may be able to give you basic advice on your project, they are not expected to ask as a direct instructor. If you have a project where you would like one-on-one guidance, please reach out to matt@theveraproject.org to request private tutoring.\n\n3\\. I really want to use your studio during an Open Session, but there are no slots available?\n\nOur studio is in high demand, so we apologize if our Open Session is sold out — We have limited space in the studio and several events every day at Vera, so it can be difficult for us to find more time for Open Sessions. If you're interested in booking the studio outside of Open Sessions, please email matt@theveraproject.org to discuss private rental rates and availability.\n\nPresented by The Vera Project.\n\nThis is an All Ages event.

Our Open Sessions are looked over by a volunteer moderator, who can provide you with advice and guidance for anything taught in our Screen Printing 101 class.

Stencils are $5 each and can be paid via Debit/Credit when you arrive.\n\nIf you are not interested in getting a stencil printed at Vera, you can print your own on transparency at a FedEx or similar print service location.\n\n2\\.
